TI  - Tyrosine kinase inhibitors - a review on pharmacology, metabolism and side 
      effects.
PG  - 470-81
AB  - Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are effective in the targeted treatment of 
      various malignancies. Imatinib was the first to be introduced into clinical 
      oncology, and it was followed by drugs such as gefitinib, erlotinib, sorafenib, 
      sunitinib, and dasatinib. Although they share the same mechanism of action, 
      namely competitive ATP inhibition at the catalytic binding site of tyrosine 
      kinase, they differ from each other in the spectrum of targeted kinases, their 
      pharmacokinetics as well as substance-specific adverse effects. With variations 
      from drug to drug, tyrosine kinase inhibitors cause skin toxicity, including 
      folliculitis, in more than 50% of patients. Among the tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
      that are commercially available as yet, the agents that target EGFR, erlotinib 
      and gefitinib, display the broadest spectrum of adverse effects on skin and hair, 
      including folliculitis, paronychia, facial hair growth, facial erythema, and 
      varying forms of frontal alopecia. In contrast, folliculitis is not common during 
      administration of sorafenib and sunitinib, which target VEGFR, PDGFR, FLT3, and 
      others, whereas both agents have been associated with subungual splinter 
      hemorrhages. Periorbital edema is a common adverse effect of imatinib. Besides 
      the haematological side effects of most of TKIs like anemia, thrombopenia and 
      neutropenia, the most common extra-heamatologic adverse effects are edema, 
      nausea, hypothyroidism, vomiting and diarrhea. Regarding possible long term 
      effects, recently cardiac toxicity with congestive heart failure is under debate 
      in patients receiving imatinib and sunitinib therapy; however, this observation 
      was probably relate to patients selection, although, TKIs overall appear to be a 
      very well tolerated drug class.

TI  - FLT3 inhibitors in acute myeloid leukemia: ten frequently asked questions.
PG  - 682-696
LID - 10.1038/s41375-019-0694-3 [doi]
AB  - The FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene is mutated in approximately one third 
      of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), either by internal tandem 
      duplications (FLT3-ITD), or by a point mutation mainly involving the tyrosine 
      kinase domain (FLT3-TKD). Patients with FLT3-ITD have a high risk of relapse and 
      low cure rates. Several FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed in 
      the last few years with variable kinase inhibitory properties, pharmacokinetics, 
      and toxicity profiles. FLT3 inhibitors are divided into first generation 
      multi-kinase inhibitors (such as sorafenib, lestaurtinib, midostaurin) and next 
      generation inhibitors (such as quizartinib, crenolanib, gilteritinib) based on 
      their potency and specificity of FLT3 inhibition. These diverse FLT3 inhibitors 
      have been evaluated in myriad clinical trials as monotherapy or in combination 
      with conventional chemotherapy or hypomethylating agents and in various settings, 
      including front-line, relapsed or refractory disease, and maintenance therapy 
      after consolidation chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In this 
      practical question-and-answer-based review, the main issues faced by the leukemia 
      specialists on the use of FLT3 inhibitors in AML are addressed.

AB  - Liver cancer is highly malignant and insensitive to cytotoxic chemotherapy and is 
      associated with very poor patient prognosis. In 2007, the small-molecule targeted 
      drug sorafenib was approved for the treatment of advanced liver cancer. In the 
      subsequent ten years, sorafenib has been the only first-line therapeutic targeted 
      drug for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, a number of clinical 
      studies show that a considerable percentage of patients with liver cancer are 
      insensitive to sorafenib. The number of patients who actually benefit 
      significantly from sorafenib treatment is very limited, and the overall efficacy 
      of sorafenib is far from satisfactory, which has attracted the attention of 
      researchers. Based on previous studies and reports, this article reviews the 
      potential mechanisms of sorafenib resistance (SR) and summarizes the biomarkers 
      and clinicopathological indicators that might be used for predicting sorafenib 
      response and developing personalized therapy.

TI  - Sorafenib in Combination With Standard Chemotherapy for Children With High 
      Allelic Ratio FLT3/ITD+ Acute Myeloid Leukemia: A Report From the Children's 
      Oncology Group Protocol AAML1031.
PG  - 2023-2035
LID - 10.1200/JCO.21.01612 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: High allelic ratio (HAR) FLT3/ITD (AR > 0.4) mutations confer poor 
      prognosis in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML). COG AAML1031 studied the 
      feasibility and efficacy of adding sorafenib, a multikinase tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitor to standard chemotherapy and as single-agent maintenance therapy in 
      this population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were treated in three cohorts. 
      The initial safety phase defined the maximum tolerated dose of sorafenib starting 
      in induction 2. Cohorts 2 and 3 added sorafenib in induction and as single-agent 
      maintenance. Clinical outcome analysis was limited to n = 72 patients in cohorts 
      2/3 and compared with n = 76 HAR FLT3/ITD+ AML patients who received identical 
      chemotherapy without sorafenib. Sorafenib pharmacokinetics and plasma inhibitory 
      activity were measured in a subset of patients. RESULTS: The maximum tolerated 
      dose of sorafenib was 200 mg/m(2) once daily; dose-limiting toxicities included 
      rash (n = 2; 1 grade 3 and 1 grade 2), grade 2 hand-foot syndrome, and grade 3 
      fever. Pharmacokinetics/plasma inhibitory activity data demonstrated that 
      measured plasma concentrations were sufficient to inhibit phosphorylated FLT3. 
      Although outcomes were superior with sorafenib in cohorts 2 and 3, patients 
      treated with sorafenib also underwent hematopoietic stem-cell transplant more 
      frequently than the comparator population. Multivariable analysis that accounted 
      for both hematopoietic stem-cell transplant and favorable co-occurring mutations 
      confirmed sorafenib's benefit. Specifically, risk of an event was approximately 
      two-fold higher in HAR FLT3/ITD+ patients who did not receive sorafenib 
      (event-free survival from study entry: hazard ratio [HR] 2.37, 95% CI, 1.45 to 
      3.88, P < .001, disease-free survival from complete remission: HR 2.28, 95% CI, 
      1.08 to 4.82, P = .032, relapse risk from complete remission: HR 3.03, 95% CI 
      1.31 to 7.04, P = .010). CONCLUSION: Sorafenib can be safely added to 
      conventional AML chemotherapy and may improve outcomes in pediatric HAR FLT3/ITD+ 
      AML.

TI  - The plasma and cerebrospinal fluid pharmacokinetics of sorafenib after 
      intravenous administration in non-human primates.
PG  - 524-8
LID - 10.1007/s10637-010-9585-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib is a small molecule inhibitor of multiple signaling kinases 
      thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of many tumors including brain tumors. 
      Clinical trials with sorafenib in primary and metastatic brain tumors are 
      ongoing. We evaluated the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pharmacokinetics 
      (PK) of sorafenib after an intravenous (IV) dose in a non-human primate (NHP) 
      model. METHODS: 7.3 mg/kg of sorafenib free base equivalent solubilized in 20% 
      cyclodextrin was administered IV over 1 h to three adult rhesus monkeys. Serial 
      paired plasma and CSF samples were collected over 24 h. Sorafenib was quantified 
      with a validated HPLC/tandem mass spectrometry assay. PK parameters were 
      estimated using non-compartmental methods. CSF penetration was calculated from 
      the AUC(CSF) : AUC(plasma). RESULTS: Peak plasma concentrations after IV dosing 
      ranged from 3.4 to 7.6 μg/mL. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) area under the 
      plasma concentration from 0 to 24 h was 28 ± 4.3 μg • h/mL, which is comparable 
      to the exposure observed in humans at recommended doses. The mean ± SD clearance 
      was 1.7 ± 0.5 mL/min/kg. The peak CSF concentrations ranged from 0.00045 to 
      0.00058 μg/mL. The mean ± SD area under the CSF concentration from 0 to 24h was 
      0.0048 ± 0.0016 μg•h/mL. The mean CSF penetration of sorafenib was 0.02% and 3.4% 
      after correcting for plasma protein binding. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib is well 
      tolerated in NHP and measurable in CSF after an IV dose. The CSF penetration of 
      sorafenib is limited relative to total and free drug exposure in plasma.

TI  - Pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of sorafenib in patients with 
      hepatocellular carcinoma: Implications for combination trials.
PG  - 2476-2488
LID - 10.1111/liv.14587 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sorafenib and lenvatinib are the first-line treatments 
      approved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but information is lacking about the 
      relationships between their pharmacokinetics, patients pharmacogenetic profiles, 
      adverse events (AE) and overall survival. We aimed to elucidate these 
      relationships of tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors, such as sorafenib, in order to 
      improve the design of trials testing it in combination with checkpoint 
      inhibitors. METHODS: We assessed the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib and its 
      N-oxide metabolite at day-0, day-7, day-30, day-60, day-90, day-120, day-150 and 
      day-180 and nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in five genes related to 
      sorafenib metabolism/transport to identify the best point for starting the 
      combination between tyrosine kinases and checkpoint inhibitors. RESULTS: We 
      prospectively included 49 patients (96% cirrhotic, 37% hepatitis-C, 82% 
      Child-Pugh-A and 59% BCLC-C). Pharmacokinetic values peaked at day-7 and 
      progressively declined until day-60. In the 16 patients without further dose 
      modifications after day-60, pharmacokinetic values remained stable through 
      day-180 (sorafenib P = .90; N-oxide P = .93). Pharmacokinetic values were higher 
      in patients with early dermatological adverse events and lower in patients with 
      early diarrhoea. Sorafenib and N-oxide pharmacokinetic values varied linearly 
      with different alleles of MRP2*3972. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib's pharmacokinetics is 
      heterogeneous across HCC patients. This heterogeneity affects adverse events 
      development and must be taken into account in setting the dose and timing of its 
      combination with checkpoint inhibitors.

TI  - Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Transarterial Chemoembolization 
      and Targeted Therapies in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 983-1014
LID - 10.1007/s40262-019-00740-w [doi]
AB  - The management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is based on a multidisciplinary 
      decision tree. Treatment includes loco-regional therapy, mainly transarterial 
      chemoembolization, for intermediate-stage HCC and systemic therapy with oral 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for advanced HCC. Transarterial 
      chemoembolization involves hepatic intra-arterial infusion with either 
      conventional procedure or drug-eluting-beads. The aim of the loco-regional 
      procedure is to deliver treatment as close as possible to the tumor both to 
      embolize the tumor area and to enhance efficacy and minimize systemic toxicity of 
      the anticancer drug. Pharmacokinetic studies applied to transarterial 
      chemoembolization are rare and pharmacodynamic studies even rarer. However, all 
      available studies lead to the same conclusions: use of the transarterial route 
      lowers systemic exposure to the cytotoxic drug and leads to much higher tumor 
      drug concentrations than does a similar dose via the intravenous route. However, 
      reproducibility of the procedure remains a major problem, and no consensus exists 
      regarding the choice of anticancer drug and its dosage. Systemic therapy with 
      TKIs is based on sorafenib and lenvatinib as first-line treatment and regorafenib 
      and cabozantinib as second-line treatment. Clinical use of TKIs is challenging 
      because of their complex pharmacokinetics, with high liver metabolism yielding 
      both active metabolites and their common toxicities. Changes in liver function 
      over time with the progression of HCC adds further complexity to the use of TKIs. 
      The challenges posed by TKIs and the HCC disease process means monitoring of TKIs 
      is required to improve clinical management. To date, only partial data supporting 
      sorafenib monitoring is available. Results from further 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies of these four TKIs are eagerly awaited 
      and are expected to permit such monitoring and the development of consensus 
      guidelines.

TI  - Sorafenib Population Pharmacokinetics and Skin Toxicities in Children and 
      Adolescents with Refractory/Relapsed Leukemia or Solid Tumor Malignancies.
PG  - 7320-7330
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-0470 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the pharmacokinetics and skin toxicity profile of sorafenib 
      in children with refractory/relapsed malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Sorafenib was administered concurrently or sequentially with clofarabine and 
      cytarabine to patients with leukemia or with bevacizumab and cyclophosphamide to 
      patients with solid tumor malignancies. The population pharmacokinetics (PPK) of 
      sorafenib and its metabolites and skin toxicities were evaluated. RESULTS: In PPK 
      analysis, older age, bevacizumab and cyclophosphamide regimen, and higher 
      creatinine were associated with decreased sorafenib apparent clearance (CL/f; P < 
      0.0001 for all), and concurrent clofarabine and cytarabine administration was 
      associated with decreased sorafenib N-oxide CL/f (P = 7e-4). Higher bilirubin was 
      associated with decreased sorafenib N-oxide and glucuronide CL/f (P = 1e-4). 
      Concurrent use of organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 inhibitors was 
      associated with increased sorafenib and decreased sorafenib glucuronide CL/f (P < 
      0.003). In exposure-toxicity analysis, a shorter time to development of grade 2-3 
      hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) was associated with concurrent (P = 0.0015) but 
      not with sequential (P = 0.59) clofarabine and cytarabine administration, 
      compared with bevacizumab and cyclophosphamide, and with higher steady-state 
      concentrations of sorafenib (P = 0.0004) and sorafenib N-oxide (P = 0.0275). In 
      the Bayes information criterion model selection, concurrent clofarabine and 
      cytarabine administration, higher sorafenib steady-state concentrations, larger 
      body surface area, and previous occurrence of rash appeared in the four best 
      two-predictor models of HFSR. Pharmacokinetic simulations showed that once-daily 
      and every-other-day sorafenib schedules would minimize exposure to sorafenib 
      steady-state concentrations associated with HFSR. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib skin 
      toxicities can be affected by concurrent medications and sorafenib steady-state 
      concentrations. The described PPK model can be used to refine exposure-response 
      relations for alternative dosing strategies to minimize skin toxicity.

TI  - FLT3 inhibitors in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia: current status and 
      future perspectives.
PG  - 427-442

AB  - Mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene arise in 25-30% of all 
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. These mutations lead to constitutive 
      activation of the protein product and are divided in two broad types: internal 
      tandem duplication (ITD) of the juxtamembrane domain (25% of cases) and point 
      mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD). Patients with FLT3 ITD mutations 
      have a high relapse risk and inferior cure rates, whereas the role of FLT3 TKD 
      mutations still remains to be clarified. Additionally, growing research indicates 
      that FLT3 status evolves through a disease continuum (clonal evolution), where 
      AML cases can acquire FLT3 mutations at relapse - not present in the moment of 
      diagnosis. Several FLT3 inhibitors have been tested in patients with FLT3-mutated 
      AML. These drugs exhibit different kinase inhibitory profiles, pharmacokinetics 
      and adverse events. First-generation multi-kinase inhibitors (sorafenib, 
      midostaurin, lestaurtinib) are characterized by a broad-spectrum of drug targets, 
      whereas second-generation inhibitors (quizartinib, crenolanib, gilteritinib) show 
      more potent and specific FLT3 inhibition, and are thereby accompanied by less 
      toxic effects. Notwithstanding, all FLT3 inhibitors face primary and acquired 
      mechanisms of resistance, and therefore the combinations with other drugs 
      (standard chemotherapy, hypomethylating agents, checkpoint inhibitors) and its 
      application in different clinical settings (upfront therapy, maintenance, 
      relapsed or refractory disease) are under study in a myriad of clinical trials. 
      This review focuses on the role of FLT3 mutations in AML, pharmacological 
      features of FLT3 inhibitors, known mechanisms of drug resistance and accumulated 
      evidence for the use of FLT3 inhibitors in different clinical settings.

TI  - The effects of triptolide on the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib in rats and its 
      potential mechanism.
PG  - 1863-1867
LID - 10.1080/13880209.2017.1340963 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Combining sorafenib with triptolide could inhibit tumour growth with 
      greater efficacy than single-agent treatment. However, their herb-drug 
      interaction remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the herb-drug 
      interaction between triptolide and sorafenib. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects 
      of triptolide (10 mg/kg) on the pharmacokinetics of different doses of sorafenib 
      (20, 50 and 100 mg/kg) in rats, and blood samples were collected within 48 h and 
      evaluated using LC-MS/MS. The effects of triptolide on the absorption and 
      metabolism of sorafenib were also investigated using Caco-2 cell monolayer model 
      and rat liver microsome incubation systems. RESULTS: The results showed that the 
      C(max) (low dose: 72.38 ± 8.76 versus 49.15 ± 5.46 ng/mL; medium dose: 
      178.65 ± 21.05 versus 109.31 ± 14.17 ng/mL; high dose: 332.81 ± 29.38 versus 
      230.86 ± 9.68 ng/mL) of sorafenib at different doses increased significantly with 
      the pretreatment of triptolide, and while the oral clearance rate of sorafenib 
      decreased. The t(1/2) of sorafenib increased significant (p < 0.05) from 
      9.02 ± 1.16 to 12.17 ± 2.95 h at low dose with the pretreatment of triptolide. 
      Triptolide has little effect on the absorption of sorafenib in Caco-2 cell 
      transwell model. However, triptolide could significantly decrease the intrinsic 
      clearance rate of sorafenib from 51.7 ± 6.37 to 32.4 ± 4.43 μL/min/mg protein in 
      rat liver microsomes. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that 
      triptolide could change the pharmacokinetic profiles of sorafenib in rats; these 
      effects might be exerted via decreasing the intrinsic clearance rate of sorafenib 
      in rat liver.

      pharmacokinetic studies of sorafenib and metabolites were conducted in 30 
      children and young adults (17 males; median age, 9.5 years) receiving sorafenib 
      150 mg/m(2) or 200 mg/m(2) twice daily. Sorafenib metabolism was evaluated in 
      vitro at 10 μmol/L using a panel of purified human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. 
      Sorafenib metabolism and CYP3A4 expression was evaluated in 52 human liver 
      samples from donors of ≤20 years old. The drug-drug interaction potential between 
      sorafenib and azole antifungal agents was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. 
      RESULTS: No age-related differences in sorafenib apparent oral clearance were 
      observed. Mean sorafenib N-oxide metabolite ratio was 0.27 ± 0.14. In children of 
      ≤10 years of age, boys had approximately 2-fold higher N-oxide ratios than girls 
      (0.40 ± 0.15 vs. 0.22 ± 0.12, P = 0.026). Of the CYPs evaluated, sorafenib was 
      exclusively metabolized to sorafenib N-oxide by CYP3A4. A trend for increased 
      N-oxide formation in boys was observed in liver samples, which correlated with 
      CYP3A4 mRNA expression. Posaconazole and voriconazole potently inhibited 
      sorafenib N-oxide formation in vitro, and reduced sorafenib N-oxide formation in 
      3 children given sorafenib concurrent with azoles. CONCLUSION: We have identified 
      several factors affecting interpatient variability in sorafenib metabolism to the 
      active N-oxide metabolite including age, sex, and concurrent treatment with azole 
      antifungals. This knowledge may provide important considerations for the clinical 
      use of sorafenib in children and possibly other kinase inhibitors undergoing 
      CYP3A4-mediated metabolism.

AB  - PURPOSE: Heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 inhibition affects the Raf kinase signaling 
      pathway and could enhance antitumor effects of sorafenib, a Raf kinase inhibitor. 
      The combination of sorafenib and tanespimycin [17-allyl-amino-geldanamycin 
      (17-AAG); NSC 330507/KOS-953] was evaluated in a phase I trial with the primary 
      objective of defining a phase II dose. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The dose cohorts 
      consisted of fixed continuous oral dosing of 400 mg sorafenib twice daily, 
      starting at 14 days before tanespimycin, which was administered intravenously at 
      escalating doses (starting at 300 mg/m,(2) with 50 mg/m(2) increments), on days 
      1, 8, and 15 in a 28-day cycle. Toxicity was assessed weekly, and response was 
      evaluated every two cycles. RESULTS: Twenty-seven toxicity-evaluable patients 
      were enrolled and treated at four dose levels. Predominant primary malignancies 
      were renal cancer (12), melanoma (6), and colorectal cancer (4). Dose-limiting 
      toxicities of grade 4 transaminitis and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome in one patient 
      each were observed at 450 mg/m(2) of tanespimycin. One hundred fourteen cycles 
      were administered with a median of four cycles (range 1-17 cycles). Plasma 
      concentrations of sorafenib and metabolites reached steady state after 7 days. 
      Tanespimycin did not alter sorafenib concentrations. Pharmacodynamics showed a 
      decrease in Hsp90 levels and induction of Hsp70. Clinical efficacy was observed 
      in 9 of 12 renal cancer patients and 4 of 6 melanoma patients CONCLUSIONS: 
      Recommended phase II doses of this combination are 400 mg sorafenib twice daily 
      and 400 mg/m(2) tanespimycin on days 1, 8, and 15, every 28 days. Clinical and 
      pharmacodynamic activity was observed in kidney cancer and melanoma.

TI  - A Hepatocellular Carcinoma Targeting Nanostrategy with Hypoxia-Ameliorating and 
      Photothermal Abilities that, Combined with Immunotherapy, Inhibits Metastasis and 
      Recurrence.
PG  - 12679-12696
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.0c01453 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common and highly malignant tumor that is 
      prone to recurrence and metastasis and has no effective treatment. 
      Unsurprisingly, its prognosis is quite poor; early detection methods and 
      effective low-toxicity treatments are urgently needed. To achieve these goals, we 
      designed a multifunctional, U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved Prussian 
      blue (PB) nanoparticle (NP) with a porous metal organic frame loaded with 
      sorafenib (SF), conjugated with HCC-specific targeting peptide SP94 and the 
      near-infrared dye cyanine (Cy)5.5. These NPs are amenable to multimodal imaging 
      for dynamic monitoring of their biodistribution and tumor-targeting effects. The 
      SP94-PB-SF-Cy5.5 NPs achieved targeted delivery and controlled SF release and 
      exhibited good photothermal effects. In this strategy, photothermal therapy and 
      SF treatment complement each other, reducing the side effects of SF and achieving 
      a therapeutic effect without local tumor recurrence. In addition, the 
      catalase-like ability of the NPs alleviates tumor hypoxia, and their photothermal 
      effects induce immunogenic cell death, leading to the release of tumor-associated 
      antigens. These effects combine to trigger an antitumor immune response; the NPs 
      also displayed promising inhibitory effects on tumor metastasis and recurrence 
      and produced an abscopal effect and long-term immunological memory when combined 
      with antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunotherapy. These safe, 
      multifunctional NPs represent a valuable treatment option for HCC. In addition, 
      this next-generation treatment model may provide some ideas for the management of 
      HCC and other cancers.

PG  - 521-32
LID - 10.1007/s10637-015-0214-x [doi]
AB  - Axitinib, a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3, showed improved progression-free 
      survival over sorafenib in patients previously treated for advanced renal cell 
      carcinoma in the AXIS trial. Although a few studies had established the efficacy 
      and safety of axitinib in Asian patients, additional evaluation was necessary to 
      obtain regulatory approval in several Asian countries, especially in light of 
      ethnic differences that are known to exist in genetic polymorphisms for 
      metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5, CYP2C19 and uridine 
      diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1, which are involved in axitinib 
      metabolism. Axitinib plasma pharmacokinetics following single or multiple 
      administration of oral axitinib in Asian (Japanese or Chinese) healthy subjects 
      as well as Asian patients with advanced solid tumors was compared with that 
      obtained in Caucasians. Upon review, the data demonstrated that axitinib can be 
      characterized as not sensitive to ethnic factors based on its pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic properties. Axitinib exhibited similar pharmacokinetics in Asian 
      and non-Asian subjects. A pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated 
      lack of a clinically meaningful effect of ethnicity on axitinib disposition. 
      Therefore, dose adjustment for axitinib on the basis of ethnicity is not 
      currently warranted.

AB  - Sorafenib is a molecularly targeted drug used for treating hepatocellular 
      carcinoma. However, sorafenib may affect the function of normal hepatocytes, and 
      the clinical application of sorafenib is limited due to its adverse effects. The 
      aim of the current study was to improve the effectiveness of sorafenib by 
      preparing it as a nanoparticle formulation using nanoprecipitation technology. 
      Sorafenib was combined with a polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether-racemic 
      polylactic acid copolymer. The properties of the nanoparticles, including 
      particle size, ξ potential and release efficiency, were measured. The 
      pharmacokinetic profile, tissue distribution and tumor-inhibiting effects of the 
      nanoparticles were determined in vitro and in vivo. Compared with sorafenib, the 
      nanoparticle formulation exhibited a significant increase in in vivo retention 
      time. The concentration of sorafenib in tumor tissues was significantly higher 
      than that in normal tissues following treatment with sorafenib nanoparticles. 
      Sorafenib nanoparticles were more efficacious in inhibiting tumor growth compared 
      with sorafenib alone. The results, provided they can be extended to humans, 
      suggest that sorafenib nanoparticles may specifically target hepatocellular 
      carcinoma.

AB  - PURPOSE: Many tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) undergo extensive hepatic 
      metabolism, but mechanisms of their hepatocellular uptake remain poorly 
      understood. We hypothesized that liver uptake of TKIs is mediated by the solute 
      carriers OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Transport of crizotinib, 
      dasatinib, gefitinib, imatinib, nilotinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, sunitinib, 
      vandetanib, and vemurafenib was studied in vitro using artificial membranes 
      (PAMPA) and HEK293 cell lines stably transfected with OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or the 
      ortholog mouse transporter, Oatp1b2. Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted with 
      Oatp1b2-knockout mice and humanized OATP1B1- or OATP1B3-transgenic mice. RESULTS: 
      All 10 TKIs were identified as substrates of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or both. Transport 
      of sorafenib was investigated further, as its diffusion was particularly low in 
      the PAMPA assay (<4%) than other TKIs that were transported by both OATP1B1 and 
      OATP1B3. Whereas Oatp1b2 deficiency in vivo had minimal influence on parent and 
      active metabolite N-oxide drug exposure, plasma levels of the glucuronic acid 
      metabolite of sorafenib (sorafenib-glucuronide) were increased more than 8-fold 
      in Oatp1b2-knockout mice. This finding was unrelated to possible changes in 
      intrinsic metabolic capacity for sorafenib-glucuronide formation in hepatic or 
      intestinal microsomes ex vivo. Ensuing experiments revealed that 
      sorafenib-glucuronide was itself a transported substrate of Oatp1b2 (17.5-fold 
      vs. control), OATP1B1 (10.6-fold), and OATP1B3 (6.4-fold), and introduction of 
      the human transporters in Oatp1b2-knockout mice provided partial restoration of 
      function. CONCLUSIONS: These findings signify a unique role for OATP1B1 and 
      OATP1B3 in the elimination of sorafenib-glucuronide and suggest a role for these 
      transporters in the in vivo handling of glucuronic acid conjugates of drugs.

AB  - The tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib (SOR) is being used increasingly in 
      combination with other anticancer agents like paclitaxel, but this increases the 
      potential for drug toxicity. SOR inhibits several human CYPs, including CYP2C8, 
      which is a major enzyme in the elimination of oncology drugs like paclitaxel and 
      imatinib. It has been reported that CYP2C8 inhibition by SOR in human liver 
      microsomes is potentiated by NADPH-dependent biotransformation. This implicates a 
      SOR metabolite in enhanced inhibition, although the identity of that metabolite 
      is presently unclear. The present study evaluated the capacity of the major 
      N-oxide metabolite of SOR (SNO) to inhibit CYP2C8-dependent paclitaxel 
      6α-hydroxylation. The IC(50) of SNO against CYP2C8 activity was found to be 
      3.7-fold lower than that for the parent drug (14 μM versus 51 μM). In molecular 
      docking studies, both SOR and SNO interacted with active site residues in CYP2C8, 
      but four additional major hydrogen and halogen bonding interactions were 
      identified between SNO and amino acids in the B-B' loop region and helixes F' and 
      I that comprise the catalytic region of the enzyme. In contrast, the binding of 
      both SOR and SNO to active site residues in the closely related human CYP2C9 
      enzyme was similar, as were the IC(50)s determined against CYP2C9-mediated 
      losartan oxidation. These findings suggest that the active metabolite SNO could 
      impair the elimination of coadministered drugs that are substrates for CYP2C8, 
      and mediate toxic adverse events, perhaps in those individuals in whom SNO is 
      formed extensively.

TI  - Safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of sorafenib: a 
      review of four phase I trials in patients with advanced refractory solid tumors.
PG  - 426-37
AB  - Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that inhibits Raf serine/threonine 
      kinases and receptor tyrosine kinases involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis. 
      It has demonstrated preclinical and clinical activity in several tumor types. 
      Sorafenib 400 mg twice daily (bid) has been approved in several countries 
      worldwide for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. This review summarizes key 
      safety, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy data from four phase I, single-agent, 
      dose-escalation studies with sorafenib in patients with advanced refractory solid 
      tumors (n = 173). These trials followed different treatment regimens (7 days on/7 
      days off, n = 19; 21 days on/7 days off, n = 44; 28 days on/7 days off, n = 41; 
      or continuous dosing, n = 69) to establish the optimum dosing schedule. Sorafenib 
      was generally well tolerated; most adverse events were mild to moderate in 
      severity up to the defined maximum-tolerated dose of 400 mg twice daily (bid). 
      The most frequently reported drug-related adverse events at any grade included 
      fatigue (40%), anorexia (35%), diarrhea (34%), rash/desquamation (27%), and 
      hand-foot skin reaction (25%). Sorafenib demonstrated preliminary antitumor 
      activity, particularly among patients with renal cell carcinoma or hepatocellular 
      carcinoma: overall, two of 137 evaluable patients achieved partial responses and 
      38 (28%) had stable disease. Although there was high interpatient variability in 
      plasma pharmacokinetics across these studies, this was not associated with an 
      increased incidence or severity of toxicity. Preliminary studies suggest that 
      phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase in tumor cells or peripheral 
      blood lymphocytes may be a useful biomarker for measuring and, ultimately, 
      predicting the effects of sorafenib. Based on these findings, continuous daily 
      400 mg bid sorafenib was chosen as the optimal regimen for phase II/III studies. 
      Trials are ongoing in renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, 
      and non-small cell lung cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug delivery systems based on Human Serum Albumin (HSA) have been 
      widely investigated due to their capability to interact with several molecules 
      together with their nontoxicity, non-immunogenicity and biocompatibility. 
      Sorafenib (SOR) is a kinase inhibitor used as the firstline treatment in hepatic 
      cancer. However, because of its several intrinsic drawbacks (low solubility and 
      bioavailability), there is a growing need for discovering new carriers able to 
      overcome the current limitations. OBJECTIVES: To study HSA particles loaded with 
      SOR as a thermal responsive drug delivery system. METHODS: A detailed 
      spectroscopy analysis of the HSA and SOR interaction in solution was carried out 
      in order to characterize the temperature dependence of the complex. Based on this 
      study, the synthesis of HSA particles loaded with SOR was optimized. Particles 
      were characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering, Atomic Force Microscopy and by 
      spectrofluorometer. Encapsulation efficiency and in vitro drug release were 
      quantified by RP-HPLC. RESULTS: HSA particles were monodispersed in size (≈ 200 
      nm); encapsulation efficiency ranged from 25% to 58%. Drug release studies that 
      were performed at 37 °C and 50 °C showed that HS5 particles achieved a drug 
      release of 0.430 μM in 72 hours at 50 °C in PBS buffer, accomplishing a 4.6-fold 
      overall SOR release enhancement following a temperature increase from 37 °C to 50 
      °C. CONCLUSION: The system herein presented has the potential to exert a 
      therapeutic action (in the nM range) triggering a sustained 
      temperature-controllable release of relevant drugs.

TI  - Sorafenib metabolism, transport, and enterohepatic recycling: physiologically 
      based modeling and simulation in mice.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study used uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to evaluate a 
      physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of the complex mechanisms of 
      sorafenib and its two main metabolites, sorafenib glucuronide and sorafenib 
      N-oxide in mice. METHODS: A PBPK model for sorafenib and its two main metabolites 
      was developed to explain disposition in mice. It included relevant influx (Oatp) 
      and efflux (Abcc2 and Abcc3) transporters, hepatic metabolic enzymes (CYP3A4 and 
      UGT1A9), and intestinal β-glucuronidase. Parameterization of drug-specific 
      processes was based on in vitro, ex vivo, and in silico data along with plasma 
      and liver pharmacokinetic data from single and multiple transporter knockout 
      mice. RESULTS: Uncertainty analysis demonstrated that the model structure and 
      parameter values could explain the observed variability in the pharmacokinetic 
      data. Global sensitivity analysis demonstrated the global effects of metabolizing 
      enzymes on sorafenib and metabolite disposition and the local effects of 
      transporters on their respective substrate exposures. In addition, through 
      hypothesis testing, the model supported that the influx transporter Oatp is a 
      weak substrate for sorafenib and a strong substrate for sorafenib glucuronide and 
      that the efflux transporter Abcc2 is not the only transporter affected in the 
      Abcc2 knockout mouse. CONCLUSIONS: Translation of the mouse model to humans for 
      the purpose of explaining exceptionally high human pharmacokinetic variability 
      and its relationship with exposure-dependent dose-limiting toxicities will 
      require delineation of the importance of these processes on disposition.

TI  - Sorafenib and sunitinib: novel targeted therapies for renal cell cancer.
PG  - 1125-44
AB  - Renal cell cancer (RCC) is a relatively uncommon malignancy, with 51,190 cases 
      expected to be diagnosed in 2007. Localized disease is curable by surgery; 
      however, locally advanced or metastatic disease is not curable in most cases and, 
      until recently, had a limited response to drug treatment. Historically, biologic 
      response modifiers or immunomodulating agents were tested in clinical trials 
      based on observations that some cases of RCC can spontaneously regress. High-dose 
      aldesleukin is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as a 
      treatment for advanced RCC; however, the drug is associated with a high frequency 
      of severe adverse effects. Responses have been observed with low-dose aldesleukin 
      and interferon alfa, but with little effect on overall survival. Sorafenib and 
      sunitinib are novel therapies that target growth factor receptors known to be 
      activated by the hypoxia-inducible factor and the Ras-Raf/MEK/ERK pathways. These 
      pathways are important in the pathophysiology of RCC. Sorafenib and sunitinib 
      have shown antitumor activity as first- and second-line therapy in patients with 
      cytokine-refractory metastatic RCC who have clear-cell histology. Although 
      complete responses are not common, both drugs promote disease stabilization and 
      increase progression-free survival. This information suggests that disease 
      stabilization may be an important determinant for response in RCC and possibly 
      other cancers. Sorafenib and sunitinib are generally well tolerated and are 
      considered first- and second-line treatment options for patients with advanced 
      clear cell RCC. In addition, sorafenib and sunitinib have shown promising results 
      in initial clinical trials evaluating antitumor activity in patients who are 
      refractory to other antiangiogenic therapy. The most common toxicities with both 
      sorafenib and sunitinib are hand-foot syndrome, rash, fatigue, hypertension, and 
      diarrhea. Research is directed toward defining the optimal use of these new 
      agents.

AB  - IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Sorafenib is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
      that inhibits Raf serine/threonine kinases and receptor tyrosine kinases 
      (vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, 3 and platelet-derived growth 
      factor-beta, Flt-3 and c-kit) that are implicated in tumorigenesis and tumor 
      progression. Sorafenib is approved for the treatment of advanced inoperable 
      hepatocellular cancer and advanced renal cell cancer. AREAS COVERED IN THIS 
      REVIEW: The findings from the major Phase III studies that led to FDA approval of 
      this drug for the above indications are reviewed. Key aspects of sorafenib 
      pharmacology, dosing in the presence of organ dysfunction, toxicities and 
      weaknesses of the research done so far are summarized. WHAT WILL THE READER GAIN: 
      The reader will have the knowledge of the major studies that form the basis of 
      the clinical use of sorafenib, information on the upcoming Phase III trials that 
      could lead to changes in clinical practice and some insights on aspects of the 
      drugs' mechanism of action and toxicity that still remain unclear. TAKE HOME 
      MESSAGE: Sorafenib is a well-tolerated oral antiangiogenic agent approved for 
      treatment of two angiogenesis-driven cancers. Studies to broaden the clinical 
      indications and increase understanding of the clinical and laboratory biomarkers 
      of response are needed.

TI  - Phase 1 study of sorafenib and irinotecan in pediatric patients with relapsed or 
      refractory solid tumors.
PG  - e29282
LID - 10.1002/pbc.29282 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib,an orally bioavailable, multitarget tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitor, and irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, have demonstrated 
      activity in pediatric and adult malignancies. We evaluated the toxicity, 
      pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacogenomic (PGX) profile of sorafenib with 
      irinotecan in children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors and assessed the 
      feasibility of incorporating patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures as an 
      adjunct to traditional endpoints. METHODS: Sorafenib, continuous oral twice daily 
      dosing, was administered with irinotecan, orally, once daily days 1-5, repeated 
      every 21 days (NCT01518413). Based on tolerability, escalation of sorafenib 
      followed by escalation of irinotecan was planned. Three patients were initially 
      enrolled at each dose level. Sorafenib and irinotecan PK analyses were performed 
      during cycle 1. PRO measurements were collected during cycles 1 and 2. RESULTS: 
      Fifteen patients were evaluable. Two of three patients at dose level 2 
      experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), grade 3 diarrhea, and grade 3 
      hyponatremia. Therefore, dose level 1 was expanded to 12 patients and two 
      patients had DLT, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, grade 3 elevated lipase. Nine of 15 
      (60%) patients had a best response of stable disease with four patients receiving 
      ≥6 cycles. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended dose for pediatric patients was sorafenib 
      150 mg/m(2) /dose twice daily with irinotecan 70 mg/m(2) /dose daily × 5 days 
      every 21 days. This oral outpatient regimen was well tolerated and resulted in 
      prolonged disease stabilization. There were no significant alterations in the PK 
      profile of either agent when administered in combination. Patients were willing 
      and able to report their subjective experiences with this regimen.

TI  - Role of sunitinib and sorafenib in the treatment of metastatic renal cell 
      carcinoma.
PG  - 123-31
LID - 10.2146/ajhp060661 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The role of sunitinib and sorafenib in the treatment of metastatic renal 
      cell carcinoma (mRCC) is reviewed. SUMMARY: Sunitinib malate is a potent 
      inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, FMS-like 
      tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), c-KIT, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which 
      give the drug its direct antitumor and antiangiogenic properties. Sunitinib is 
      currently approved as a second-line treatment of mRCC in patients who have either 
      not responded to or who are not eligible to receive interleukin-2. Clinical 
      trials of sunitinib have found similar rates of partial response, disease 
      stabilization, and progression-free survival. Sorafenib inhibits VEGF receptors, 
      PDGF receptors, FLT3, RAF-1, and BRAF in vitro and has been shown to prevent the 
      growth of tumors but not to reduce tumor size. Sorafenib has been proven to 
      improve survival in a novel randomized discontinuation trial and a Phase III 
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial. No studies have directly compared the 
      effectiveness of sunitinib to sorafenib in the treatment of advanced renal cell 
      carcinoma. Sunitinib and sorafenib share a similar mechanism of action and 
      primarily target tumor angiogenesis by inhibiting a variety of tyrosine kinases; 
      the agents have similar toxicity, with the exception of an increased risk of 
      hypertension associated with the use of sorafenib. Sorafenib does not result in 
      tumor shrinkage, but sunitinib significantly reduces tumor size. CONCLUSION: The 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib and sunitinib offer improved outcomes for 
      patients with mRCC, but they are far short of a cure. Despite the introduction of 
      sorafenib and sunitinib, palliative care is still an acceptable treatment option 
      for mRCC because of the disease's extremely poor prognosis.

TI  - Herb-Drug Interaction between the Traditional Hepatoprotective Formulation and 
      Sorafenib on Hepatotoxicity, Histopathology and Pharmacokinetics in Rats.
LID - 10.3390/molecules22071034 [doi]
LID - 1034
AB  - Sorafenib has been used as a standard therapy for advanced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). In Asia, patients with HCC are potentially treated with the 
      combination of sorafenib and Chinese herbal medicines to improve the efficiency 
      and reduce the side effects of sorafenib. However, limited information about the 
      herb-drug interactions is available. We hypothesize that the Chinese herbal 
      medicine may exert hepatoprotective effects on the sorafenib-treated group. The 
      aim of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetic mechanism of drug-drug 
      interactions of sorafenib including interacting with hepatoprotective 
      formulation, Long-Dan-Xie-Gan-Tang formulation (LDXGT) and with two cytochrome 
      P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors, grapefruit juice and ketoconazole. Liver enzyme 
      levels and histopathology of liver slices were used to evaluate sorafenib-induced 
      hepatotoxicity and the potential hepatoprotective effects of the LDXGT 
      formulation on subjects treated with the combination of sorafenib and the herbal 
      medicine. In this study, a validated HPLC-photodiode array analytical system was 
      developed for the pharmacokinetic study of sorafenib in rats. As the result of 
      the pharmacokinetic data, pretreatment with the LDXGT formulation did not 
      significantly interact with sorafenib compared with sorafenib oral administration 
      alone. Furthermore, grapefruit juice and ketoconazole did not significantly 
      affect sorafenib metabolism. Furthermore, pretreatment with variable, single or 
      repeat doses of the LDXGT formulation did not suppress or exacerbate the 
      sorafenib-induced hepatotoxicity and histopathological alterations. According to 
      these results, the LDXGT formulation is safe, but has no beneficial effects on 
      sorafenib-induced hepatotoxicity. A detailed clinical trial should be performed 
      to further evaluate the efficacy or adverse effects of the LDXGT formulation in 
      combination with sorafenib in humans.

AB  - A 53-year-old woman with papillary thyroid cancer treated with 800 mg sorafenib 
      therapy rapidly experienced grade 3 toxicities. Dosing was reduced in a step-wise 
      manner with several treatment discontinuations down to 200 mg every 2 days but 
      severe toxicities continued. Plasma drug monitoring showed high exposure, even at 
      low dose. Dosing was then further reduced at 200 mg every 3 days and tolerance 
      was finally acceptable (i.e., grade 1 toxicity) with stable disease upon RECIST 
      imaging. Pharmacogenetic investigations showed polymorphisms affecting both 
      UGT1A9 (UGT1A9-rs3832043) and nuclear receptor PXR (NR1I2-rs3814055, 
      NR1I2-rs2472677 and NR1I2-rs10934498), possibly resulting in downregulation of 
      liver metabolizing enzymes of sorafenib (i.e., CYP and UGT). Patient's clearance 
      (0.48 l/h) estimated by Bayesian approach was consistently lower than usually 
      described. This is the first time that, in addition to mutations affecting 
      UGT1A9, genetic polymorphisms of NR1I2 have possibly been associated with both 
      plasma overexposure and severe toxicities upon sorafenib intake.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sorafenib is a novel oral bis-aryl urea compound that has proven 
      survival benefit in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), for 
      which several therapies are currently available with unsatisfactory results. 
      Sorafenib is the first compound to demonstrate a significant effect on survival 
      in HCC. AREAS COVERED: Our experience in the clinical application of sorafenib is 
      reviewed in conjunction with relevant publications in the literature. Based on ex 
      vivo and in vivo experiments, we conclude that sorafenib plays an important role 
      in blocking tumor cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and reversing multidrug 
      resistance. Antitumor activities were observed in multiple tumor types in ongoing 
      randomized Phase III studies. Toxicity was observed as tolerable. On 16 November 
      2007, sorafenib was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration 
      for the treatment of unresectable HCC, based on the results of an international, 
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with 
      unresectable, biopsy-proven HCC. EXPERT OPINION: With the approval of sorafenib 
      being given the significance of a milestone, systemic treatment of HCC is no 
      longer regarded as ineffective. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sorafenib, gives 
      us new hope for successful cancer therapy.

PG  - 2536-2546
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-4450 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety, activity, and emergence of FLT3-kinase domain 
      (KD) mutations with combination therapy of crenolanib and sorafenib in acute 
      myeloid leukemia (AML) with FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD). PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: After in vitro and xenograft efficacy studies using AML cell lines that 
      have FLT3-ITD with or without FLT3-KD mutation, a pilot study was performed with 
      crenolanib (67 mg/m2/dose, three times per day on days 1-28) and two dose levels 
      of sorafenib (150 and 200 mg/m2/day on days 8-28) in 9 pediatric patients with 
      refractory/relapsed FLT3-ITD-positive AML. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and 
      FLT3-KD mutation analysis were done in both preclinical and clinical studies. 
      RESULTS: The combination of crenolanib and sorafenib in preclinical models showed 
      synergy without affecting pharmacokinetics of each agent, inhibited p-STAT5 and 
      p-ERK for up to 8 hours, and led to significantly better leukemia response (P < 
      0.005) and survival (P < 0.05) compared with single agents. Fewer FLT3-KD 
      mutations emerged with dose-intensive crenolanib (twice daily) and low-intensity 
      sorafenib (three times/week) compared with daily crenolanib or sorafenib (P < 
      0.05). The crenolanib and sorafenib combination was tolerable without 
      dose-limiting toxicities, and three complete remissions (one with incomplete 
      count recovery) and one partial remission were observed in 8 evaluable patients. 
      Median crenolanib apparent clearance showed a nonsignificant decrease during 
      treatment (45.0, 40.5, and 20.3 L/hour/m2 on days 1, 7, and 14, respectively) 
      without drug-drug interaction. Only 1 patient developed a FLT3-KD mutation (FLT3 
      F691L). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of crenolanib and sorafenib was tolerable 
      with antileukemic activities and rare emergence of FLT3-TKD mutations, which 
      warrants further investigation.

AB  - Sorafenib (twice daily [bid]) plus capecitabine (2 weeks on schedule/1 week off 
      schedule) safety and pharmacokinetics were investigated in patients with advanced 
      solid tumors (N = 35). Cohort 1 (n = 13) included sorafenib 200 mg bid and 
      capecitabine 1050 mg/m(2) bid; cohort 2 (n = 4), sorafenib 400 mg bid and 
      capecitabine 1050 mg/m(2) bid; cohort 3 (n = 6), sorafenib 200 mg bid and 
      capecitabine 1050 mg/m(2) bid (cycles 1 and 2), then 400 mg bid and capecitabine 
      1050 mg/m(2) bid (cycle 3 onwards); and cohort 4 (n = 12), sorafenib 400 mg bid 
      and capecitabine 850 mg/m(2) bid. The combination of sorafenib and capecitabine 
      was generally well tolerated. Most frequent drug-related adverse events were 
      hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR, 89%), diarrhea (71%), and fatigue (69%). The HFSR 
      was dose-limiting toxicities in 6 patients. Sorafenib exposure (C(max) and 
      AUC(0-12)) was unaffected by concomitant capecitabine. Concomitant sorafenib 
      moderately increased capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil (metabolite) exposure when 
      the capecitabine dose was 1050 mg/m(2) bid. Simultaneous administration of 400 mg 
      bid sorafenib and 850 mg/m(2) bid capecitabine, however, had only minor effects 
      on the exposure to capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil. Based on the overall toxicity 
      profile and pharmacokinetic parameters, the recommended phase 2 doses were 
      therefore sorafenib 400 mg bid and capecitabine 850 mg/m(2) bid, as scheduled 
      above.

TI  - Sorafenib exposure and its correlation with response and safety in advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma: results from an observational retrospective study.
PG  - 129-139
LID - 10.1007/s00280-020-04105-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Severe adverse events frequently occur in patients treated with 
      sorafenib, whereas some patients have suboptimal response to sorafenib. We aimed 
      to evaluate the association of sorafenib-induced toxicities and clinical outcomes 
      with the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC). METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study in which 26 HCC 
      patients who had been treated with sorafenib were enrolled between September 2010 
      and March 2015. The association between trough sorafenib concentration and 
      occurrence of grade ≥ 3 toxicities was evaluated. In addition, we estimated the 
      association of trough sorafenib concentration with overall survival (OS). 
      RESULTS: The median sorafenib concentration was 2.91 μg/mL (range 
      0.74-8.8 μg/mL). Based on the receiver operating characteristic curve, the 
      threshold value of the trough sorafenib concentration for predicting grade ≥ 3 
      toxicities and responder (complete response or partial response at best response, 
      or stable disease for ≥ 3 months) was 3.45 μg/mL [area under the curve (AUC) 
      0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.93; p <0.05] and 1.40 μg/mL (AUC 0.97, 
      95% CI 0.97-1.00; p <0.05), respectively. OS of patients with sorafenib 
      1.40-3.45 µg/mL had a tendency to be longer than those of patients 
      administered < 1.40 μg/mL and ≥ 3.45 μg/mL [median 17.8 months (1.40-3.45 μg/mL) 
      vs. 5.3 months (< 1.40 μg/mL) and 9.5 months (≥ 3.45 μg/mL)]. CONCLUSIONS: From 
      results of this study, we proposed that the target range of sorafenib may be a 
      trough concentration of 1.40-3.45 μg/mL in patients with HCC.

AB  - In this study, an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed to simultaneously detect 15 
      targeted anti-cancer drugs: aletinib, afatinib, apatinib, icotinib, dasatinib, 
      erlotinib, gefitinib, crizotinib, lapatinib, regorafenib, ceritinib, sorafenib, 
      vemurafenib, imatinib, and N-desmethyl imatinib. Plasma samples were processed 
      using a new magnetic solid phase extraction technique to extract each drug. The 
      15 analytes and four isotope internal standards were separated using an Agilent 
      Eclipse XDB-C18 column (50.0 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 µm) with water containing 0.1% formic 
      acid and acetonitrile as the mobile phase. The method verification included 
      specificity, calibration curves, carryover, accuracy, crosstalk, precision, 
      stability, recovery, dilution integrity, and matrix effects. The results showed 
      that the developed UPLC-MS/MS method met the requirements of the U.S. Food and 
      Drug Administration guidelines for methodological validation and could be used to 
      monitor plasma concentrations. The response function was established for 
      concentration range of 2.5-2500.0 ng/mL for aletinib, afatinib, apatinib, 
      icotinib, dasatinib, crizotinib, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and N-desmethyl 
      imatinib and 10.0-10,000.0 ng/mL for erlotinib, ceritinib, imatinib, sorafenib, 
      gefitinib, and lapatinib, with a coeffificient of correlation of > 0.9977 for all 
      the compounds. The precision and accuracy of all the analytes were < 6.88% and 
      5.29%, respectively. The percentage recovery and matrix effect of all the 
      analytes were 91.3-103% and 93.8-102% for three QC concentrations levels. The 
      recovery and matrix effect for all the ISs ranged from 93.7% to 98.8% and 
      94.6-101%. Meanwhile, we also found that the plasma concentrations of these 
      targeted anti-cancer drugs showed large individual differences, which is not 
      conducive to the treatment of tumors. Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring 
      (TDM) of these 15 targeted anti-cancer drugs is necessary, and this method could 
      be used for TDM and exploration of pharmacokinetics of the aforementioned 15 
      targeted anti-cancer drugs.

AB  - Kinase inhibitors (KIs) and antiandrogen drugs (AAs) are oral anticancer drugs 
      with narrow therapeutic index that exhibit high inter- and intra-individual 
      variability. We describe here a UPLC-MS/MS method for the simultaneous 
      quantification of nine KIs: cobimetinib, dasatinib, ibrutinib, imatinib, 
      nilotinib, palbociclib, ruxolitinib, sorafenib and vemurafenib; two active 
      metabolites of them: N-desmethyl imatinib, N-oxide sorafenib; and two AAs: 
      abiraterone and enzalutamide; with short pre-treatment and run time in order to 
      be easily used in clinical practice for their therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) 
      and facilitating pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics studies. 
      Plasma samples were prepared by a single-step protein precipitation. Analytes 
      were separated on a Waters Acquity UPLC® T3 HSS C18 column by non-linear gradient 
      elution; with subsequent detection by Xevo® TQD triple quadrupole tandem mass 
      spectrometer in a positive ionization mode. Analysis time was 2.8 min per run, 
      and all analytes eluted within 1.46-1.97 minutes. The analytical performance of 
      the method in terms of specificity, sensitivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, 
      matrix effect, extraction recovery, limit of quantification, dilution integrity 
      and stability of analytes under different conditions met all criteria for a 
      bioanalytical method for the quantification of drugs. The calibration curves were 
      linear over the range of 1-500 ng/mL for abiraterone, dasatinib and ibrutinib; 
      5-500 ng/mL for cobimetinib and palbociclib; 10-5,000 ng/mL for imatinib, 
      N-desmethyl imatinib, nilotinib, sorafenib, N-oxide sorafenib and ruxolitinib; 
      100-50,000 ng/mL for enzalutamide and 100-100,000 ng/mL for vemurafenib with 
      coefficient of correlation above 0.995 for all analytes. This novel method was 
      successfully applied to TDM in clinical practice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet-derived Growth Factor Receptor (PDGFR) is a kind of Receptor 
      Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs). PDGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) which are small 
      molecule inhibitors targeting PDGFR prevent and block cell proliferation signal 
      transduction pathways. Recently, there have been 11 TKIs (including imatinib, 
      sunitinib, regorafenib, sorafenib, pazopanib, axitinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, 
      lenvatinib, cabozantinib and ponatinib) targeting PDGFR approved by FDA for the 
      treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, renal 
      cell carcinoma et al. Pharmacokinetics (PK) reflects the processes of drugs in 
      body, while pharmacodynamics (PD) reflects the efficacy. Genetic polymorphisms of 
      metabolizers and transporters contribute to highly inter-individual variability 
      in PK and PD. This review aims to introduce the clinical applications, 
      instruction and usage, PK, PD and pharmacogenetics of these PDGFR TKIs. METHODS: 
      In vivo and in vitro studies about PDGFR TKIs were searched from PubMed. Data and 
      information were analyzed and summarized. RESULTS: The overview of (1) general 
      information on PDGFR kinase inhibitors; (2) PK parameters of PDGFR kinase 
      inhibitors; (3) metabolic enzymes and transporters of PDGFR kinase inhibitors; 
      (4) main drug interactions of PDGFR kinase inhibitors; (5) adverse events of 
      PDGFR kinase inhibitors; and (6) genetic polymorphism on PK and PD of PDGFR 
      kinase inhibitors, was exhibited and discussed in this review. CONCLUSION: This 
      review summarized the general information, PK, metabolic enzymes and 
      transporters, main drug interactions, adverse events and pharmacogenetics of FDA 
      approved PDGFR TKIs. Studies showed that Single nucleotide polymorphisms of 
      metabolic enzymes and transporters had influence on the PK and PD of PDGFR TKIs.

TI  - Safety and anti-tumor activity of sorafenib (Nexavar) in combination with other 
      anti-cancer agents: a review of clinical trials.
PG  - 535-48
AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib (Nexavar) is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor that inhibits Raf 
      serine/threonine kinases and receptor tyrosine kinases involved in tumor growth 
      and angiogenesis. Sorafenib has demonstrated preclinical and clinical activity 
      against several tumor types, as a monotherapy and in combination with other 
      anti-cancer agents. METHODS: This review summarizes the safety, pharmacokinetics, 
      and anti-tumor activity of sorafenib combined with other targeted agents or 
      cytotoxics from a series of Phase I/II trials in approximately 600 patients with 
      advanced solid tumors. RESULTS: Sorafenib in combination with other agents was 
      generally well tolerated, and most adverse events were mild to moderate in 
      severity. Frequent drug-related toxicities were dermatologic, gastrointestinal, 
      or constitutional. Most trials supported sorafenib 400 mg bid as the recommended 
      dose for combination. Sorafenib generally had little effect on the 
      pharmacokinetics of coadministered agents and vice versa. Preliminary anti-tumor 
      activity was observed; overall disease control rates (partial response plus 
      stable disease) ranged from 33 to 92%. Particularly promising activity was 
      observed in patients with melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and non-small-cell 
      lung cancer receiving sorafenib plus paclitaxel/carboplatin, doxorubicin, and 
      gefitinib, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib demonstrated a good safety 
      profile and encouraging anti-tumor effects when coadministered with other agents 
      in patients with advanced solid tumors.

AB  - To improve the poor water solubility of sorafenib and to monitor its distribution 
      and the early feedback effects on its in vivo treatment efficacy in a precise 
      manner, sorafenib (SF) and gadolinium (Gd) co-loaded liposomes (SF/Gd-liposomes) 
      were prepared. The simultaneous imaging and therapy efficacies of the 
      SF/Gd-liposomes were tested. The solubility of SF in SF/Gd-liposomes was 
      significantly increased from 0.21 μg/mL to 250 μg/mL. The imaging capability of 
      SF/Gd-liposomes were tested by in-vitro and the in-vivo imaging ability tests and 
      the results confirmed that SF/Gd-liposomes could be served as an effective 
      contrast agent. The design of SF/Gd-liposomes allowed the MRI-guided in vivo 
      visualization of the delivery and biodistribution of liposome. In the in vivo 
      antitumor studies, SF/Gd-liposomes had better antitumor effects in H22 
      tumor-bearing mice than SF solution (oral or i.v. administration) (P<0.05). These 
      findings indicated that the SF/Gd-liposomes could be used as the promising 
      nano-carriers for the MRI-guided in vivo visualization of the delivery and HCC 
      treatment.

TI  - Safety and pharmacokinetics of ganitumab (AMG 479) combined with sorafenib, 
      panitumumab, erlotinib, or gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumors.
PG  - 3414-27
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-3369 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This phase 1b dose-escalation study assessed safety, tolerability, and 
      pharmacokinetics of ganitumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against the 
      insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) receptor, combined with targeted agents or 
      cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. EXPERIMENTAL 
      DESIGN: Patients with treatment-refractory advanced solid tumors were 
      sequentially enrolled at 2 ganitumab dose levels (6 or 12 mg/kg i.v. every 2 
      weeks) combined with either sorafenib 400 mg twice daily, panitumumab 6 mg/kg 
      every 2 weeks, erlotinib 150 mg once daily, or gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on days 
      1, 8, and 15 of each 4-week cycle. The primary end points were safety and 
      pharmacokinetics of ganitumab. RESULTS: Ganitumab up to 12 mg/kg appeared well 
      tolerated combined with sorafenib, panitumumab, erlotinib, or gemcitabine. 
      Treatment-emergent adverse events were generally mild and included fatigue, 
      nausea, vomiting, and chills. Three patients had dose-limiting toxicities: grade 
      3 hyperglycemia (ganitumab 6 mg/kg and panitumumab), grade 4 neutropenia 
      (ganitumab 6 mg/kg and gemcitabine), and grade 4 thrombocytopenia (ganitumab 12 
      mg/kg and erlotinib). Ganitumab-binding and panitumumab-binding antibodies were 
      detected in 5 and 2 patients, respectively; neutralizing antibodies were not 
      detected. The pharmacokinetics of ganitumab and each cotherapy did not appear 
      affected by coadministration. Circulating total IGF1 and IGF binding protein 3 
      increased from baseline following treatment. Four patients (9%) had partial 
      responses. CONCLUSIONS: Ganitumab up to 12 mg/kg was well tolerated, without 
      adverse effects on pharmacokinetics in combination with either sorafenib, 
      panitumumab, erlotinib, or gemcitabine. Ganitumab is currently under 
      investigation in combination with some of these and other agents.

TI  - A drug interaction study evaluating the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of 
      sorafenib in combination with capecitabine.
PG  - 137-44
LID - 10.1007/s00280-011-1674-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To address tolerability and a possible pharmacologic interaction of 
      capecitabine with sorafenib. METHODS: Patients with advanced solid tumors (ECOG 
      PS 0-1) were included. Cohort A received capecitabine 750 mg/m(2) BID and Cohort 
      B received capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) BID, both for 14 days of a 21-day cycle. 
      Steady-state PK was obtained for capecitabine alone, sorafenib alone, and in 
      combination. Cohort C explored an alternate schedule of 7-day on/7-day off flat 
      dose capecitabine 1,000 mg BID with continuous dosing of sorafenib 400 mg BID. 
      RESULTS: A total of 32 patients were enrolled between February 08 and April 09. 
      Hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) was the primary toxicity with 16 (50%) of the 32 
      patients experiencing grade 3 events (75% occurring during cycles 1-2). Grade 3 
      HFSR defined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Cohort C at 1,000 mg BID flat 
      dose of capecitabine. Other grade 3/4 toxicities were rare (diarrhea 6%, 
      mucositis 3%, and fatigue 3%). Capecitabine did not change the C (max) or 
      AUC((0-12)) of sorafenib. Co-administration of sorafenib with capecitabine 
      750 mg/m(2) (n = 6 patients) increased capecitabine AUC((0-12)) 15% and produced 
      no change in the 5FU AUC((0-12)). At the capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) dose level 
      (n = 12 pts), there was a 16% increase in capecitabine AUC((0-12)) and an 8% 
      increase in 5FU AUC((0-12)). However, these trends were not statistically 
      significant. CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of sorafenib resulted in a mild 
      increase in capecitabine AUC, although not statistically significant. 
      Capecitabine did not affect the exposure of sorafenib. The rate of grade 3 HFSR 
      is concerning and limits the feasibility of prolonged dosing of sorafenib with 
      capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on the 21-day schedule.

TI  - Association of toxicity of sorafenib and sunitinib for human keratinocytes with

AB  - Hand-foot skin reaction is a most common multi-kinase inhibitor-related adverse 
      event. This study aimed to examine whether the toxicity of sorafenib and 
      sunitinib for human keratinocytes was associated with inhibiting signal 
      transduction and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). We studied whether STAT3 
      activity affects sorafenib- and sunitinib-induced cell growth inhibition in HaCaT 
      cells by WST-8 assay. Stattic enhanced the cell-growth inhibitory and apoptotic 
      effects of sorafenib and sunitinib. HaCaT cells transfected with 
      constitutively-active STAT3 (STAT3C) were resistant to the sorafenib- and 
      sunitinib-induced cell growth inhibition. STAT3 activity decreased after 
      short-term treatment with sorafenib and sunitinib in a dose-dependent manner and 
      recovered after long-term treatment with sorafenib and sunitinib at low doses. 
      Moreover, the expression of survivin and bcl-2 decreased after treatment with 
      sorafenib and sunitinib was concomitant with variations in STAT3 activity. 
      Sorafenib-induced STAT3 inhibition was mediated by regulation via MAPK pathways 
      in HaCaT cells, while sunitinib-induced STAT3 inhibition was not. Thus, STAT3 
      activation mediating apoptosis suppressors may be a key factor in sorafenib and 
      sunitinib-induced keratinocyte cytotoxicity.

      liquid crystalline lipid nanoparticles for the treatment of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma.

AB  - In addition to early detection, early diagnosis, and early surgery, it is of 
      great significance to use new strategies for the treatment of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). Studies showed that the combination of sorafenib (SFN) and 
      triptolide (TPL) could reduce the clinical dose of SFN and maintain good anti-HCC 
      effect. But the solubility of SFN and TPL in water is low and both drugs have 
      certain toxicity. Therefore, we constructed a biomimetic nanosystem based on 
      cancer cell-platelet (PLT) hybrid membrane camouflage to co-deliver SFN and TPL 
      taking advantage of PLT membrane with long circulation functions and tumor cell 
      membrane with homologous targeting. The biomimetic nanosystem, SFN and TPL loaded 
      cancer cell-PLT hybrid membrane-camouflaged liquid crystalline lipid 
      nanoparticles ((SFN + TPL)@CPLCNPs), could simultaneously load SFN and TPL at the 
      molar ratio of SFN to TPL close to 10:1. (SFN + TPL)@CPLCNPs achieved long 
      circulation function and tumor targeting at the same time, promoting tumor cell 
      apoptosis, inhibiting tumor growth, and achieving a better "synergy and 
      attenuation effect", which provided new ideas for the treatment of HCC.

AB  - The tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib and imatinib are important in the 
      treatment of a range of cancers but adverse effects in some patients necessitate 
      dosage modifications. CYP3A4 has a major role in the oxidation of sorafenib to 
      its N-oxide and N-hydroxymethyl metabolites and also acts in concert with CYP2C8 
      to mediate imatinib N-demethylation. CYP3A4 expression and function are impaired 
      in patients with advanced liver disease, whereas the functions of CYP2C enzymes 
      are relatively preserved. We evaluated the biotransformation of sorafenib and 
      imatinib in well-characterized microsomal fractions from 17 control subjects and 
      19 individuals with hepatic cirrhosis of varying severity. The principal findings 
      were that liver disease impaired the microsomal oxidation of sorafenib to its 
      major metabolites to 40-44% of control (P<0.01), whereas the N-demethylation of 
      imatinib was relatively unimpaired. The impairments in sorafenib 
      biotransformation were correlated with decreased serum albumin concentrations and 
      increased serum bilirubin concentrations in patients with liver disease, but not 
      with the overall grade of liver disease according to the Child-Pugh system. In 
      contrast, there was no relationship between imatinib N-demethylation and 
      clinicopathologic factors in liver disease patients. These findings were 
      accounted for in terms of the differential roles of CYPs 3A4 and 2C8 in the 
      intrinsic clearance of the drugs. CYP3A4 has the major role in the intrinsic 
      clearance of sorafenib but plays a secondary role to CYP2C8 in the intrinsic 
      clearance of imatinib. In agreement with these findings CYP2C protein expression 
      and CYP2C8-mediated paclitaxel 6α-hydroxylation were unimpaired in cirrhotic 
      livers. This information could be adapted in individualized approaches such as in 
      vivo CYP3A4 phenotyping to optimize sorafenib safety and efficacy in cancer 
      patients with liver dysfunction.

AB  - Systemic therapy of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with the 
      small-molecule multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is associated with large 
      interindividual pharmacokinetic variability and unpredictable side effects 
      potentially requiring dose reduction or treatment termination. Organic cation 
      transporter (OCT1; gene SLC22A1) has been proposed as a clinical biomarker of HCC 
      response. Because proof is lacking that OCT1 transports sorafenib, we used a 
      combinatorial approach to define how OCT1 contributes to sorafenib transport. 
      Overexpression of functional OCT1 protein in Xenopus laevis oocytes and mammalian 
      cell lines did not facilitate sorafenib transport. Otherwise, sorafenib 
      considerably accumulated in liver cancer cell lines despite negligible OCT1 mRNA 
      and protein levels. Sorafenib pharmacokinetics was independent of OCT1 genotype 
      in mice. Finally, SLC22A1 mRNA expression was significantly reduced by DNA 
      methylation in The Cancer Genome Atlas HCC cohort. These results clearly 
      demonstrate OCT1-independent cellular sorafenib uptake indicating that OCT1 is 
      apparently not a valid biomarker of sorafenib response in HCC.

AB  - The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib has been used in the treatment of 
      hepatocellular carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and differentiated thyroid 
      carcinoma. Here we have demonstrated the production of the first specific 
      antibody against sorafenib. Anti-sorafenib serum was obtained by immunizing mice 
      with an antigen conjugated with bovine serum albumin and carboxylic modified 
      4-(4-aminophenoxy)-N-methyl-2-pyridinecarboxamide (AMPC) using the N-succinimidyl 
      ester method. Enzyme labeling of sorafenib with horseradish peroxidase was 
      similarly performed using carboxylic modified AMPC. A simple competitive 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for sorafenib was developed using the 
      principle of direct competition between sorafenib and the enzyme marker for 
      anti-sorafenib antibody, which had been adsorbed by the plastic surface of a 
      microtiter plate. Serum sorafenib concentrations lower than 0.04 µg/mL were 
      reproducibly measurable using the ELISA. This ELISA was specific to sorafenib and 
      showed very slight cross-reactivity (2.5%) with a major metabolite, sorafenib 
      N-oxide. The values of serum sorafenib levels from 32 patients measured by this 
      ELISA were comparable with those measured by HPLC, and there was a strong 
      correlation between the values determined by the two methods (Y=1.016X-0.137, 
      r=0.979). The specificity and sensitivity of the ELISA for sorafenib should 
      provide a valuable new tool for use in therapeutic drug monitoring and 
      pharmacokinetic studies of sorafenib.

AB  - Few data are available about sorafenib use in patients with metastatic renal cell 
      carcinoma (mRCC) undergoing hemodialysis. No systematic review has been 
      previously performed about this issue. The objective of the present review is to 
      investigate pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes of sorafenib in mRCC patients 
      undergoing hemodialysis. According to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
      Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, all the literature about mRCC 
      dialysis patients receiving sorafenib, published from January 1946 to August 
      2015, was evaluated. Applying inclusion/exclusion criteria, 11 articles were 
      selected for the analysis; 1 patient from our department was also included. The 
      investigated outcomes were pharmacokinetics, toxicity, response rate, 
      progression-free survival, and overall survival where available. A total of 36 
      patients were included. Median treatment duration was 6.0 months on overall 
      population; median progression-free survival was 6.3 months (calculated on 19 
      patients); response rate was 22% (on 29 patients); median overall survival was 
      14.9 months (on 28 patients). Of note, 24 patients started sorafenib at reduced 
      dose; 6 of 36 patients (17%) required dose reduction due to adverse events (AEs). 
      Sorafenib treatment was discontinued in 7 patients (19%) because of AEs. Most of 
      AEs were Grade 1-2; severe toxicities (Grade 4-5) included G4 anemia (1 case), G4 
      hypertension (1 case), G4 cerebellar hemorrhage (1 patient), and a case of G5 
      subarachnoid hemorrhage. This review confirmed the efficacy of sorafenib 
      treatment in mRCC patients receiving hemodialysis. Nevertheless, drug toxicity 
      seems to be increased in these patients, despite the initiation of therapy at 
      reduced doses; therefore, sorafenib should be used with caution in dialysis 
      patients.

TI  - No Effect of Levothyroxine and Levothyroxine-Induced Subclinical Thyrotoxicosis 
      on the Pharmacokinetics of Sorafenib in Healthy Male Subjects.
PG  - 1118-1127
LID - 10.1089/thy.2017.0085 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients receiving the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib for locally 
      recurrent or metastatic, progressive, differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) 
      refractory to radioactive iodine often receive concomitant levothyroxine for 
      thyrotropin (TSH) suppression. In the Phase 3 DTC trial (DECISION), sorafenib 
      exposure was approximately twofold higher than that observed in other cancers. 
      This study assessed sorafenib pharmacokinetics without and with concomitant 
      levothyroxine to examine whether a levothyroxine interaction or 
      levothyroxine-induced subclinical thyrotoxicosis results in increased sorafenib 
      exposure in patients with DTC. METHODS: This was an open-label, two-period 
      sequential treatment study in healthy male subjects. In period 1, day 1, subjects 
      received a single oral dose of sorafenib 400 mg, followed by a minimal 10-day 
      washout. In period 2, day 1, levothyroxine 300 μg was administered orally once 
      daily (q.d.) for 14 days. After 10 days, a single oral concomitant dose of 
      sorafenib 400 mg was given. Blood samples for sorafenib pharmacokinetic analyses 
      were obtained pre-dose and at time points up to 96 hours after sorafenib dosing. 
      Samples for thyroid tests were collected before and after levothyroxine dosing. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-five subjects completed the study and were evaluable for 
      pharmacokinetic analysis. Levothyroxine 300 μg q.d. was well tolerated and 
      induced subclinical thyrotoxicosis, producing full suppression of TSH 
      (M ± SD = 0.032 ± 0.027 mIU/L) and increased free thyroxine (from 0.94 ± 0.09 to 
      1.77 ± 0.33 ng/dL) and free triiodothyronine (from 2.87 ± 0.28 to 
      4.24 ± 0.66 pg/mL) levels by day 11 of period 2. The geometric mean (%CV) 
      sorafenib maximum concentration (C(max)) without and with levothyroxine was 2.09 
      (68.1) and 1.78 (63.9) mg/L, respectively, with a corresponding geometric mean 
      area under the curve of 68.1 (68.2) and 64.3 (66.3) mg·h/L. Median (range) time 
      to C(max) was 4.00 (2.98-16.0) and 4.02 (1.98-36.0) hours, respectively. Mean 
      (%CV) half-life was 24.0 (25.3) and 25.7 (21.0) hours. All study drug-related 
      adverse events were mild and included headache and fatigue for sorafenib, and 
      headache, increased alanine aminotransferase and glutamate dehydrogenase, 
      fatigue, and nervousness for levothyroxine. CONCLUSIONS: Levothyroxine 300 μg 
      q.d. for 14 days was well tolerated, induced subclinical thyrotoxicosis, and did 
      not affect sorafenib pharmacokinetics. The findings suggest that concomitant use 
      of levothyroxine with sorafenib is not likely responsible for the previously 
      reported increase in sorafenib exposure in patients with DTC. However, the 
      possible effects of long-term levothyroxine dosing were not assessed.

TI  - Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers Predictive of Survival Benefit with Lenvatinib in 
      Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma: From the Phase III REFLECT Study.
PG  - 4848-4858
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-4219 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In REFLECT, lenvatinib demonstrated an effect on overall survival (OS) 
      by confirmation of noninferiority to sorafenib in unresectable hepatocellular 
      carcinoma. This analysis assessed correlations between serum or tissue biomarkers 
      and efficacy outcomes from REFLECT. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Serum biomarkers (VEGF, 
      ANG2, FGF19, FGF21, and FGF23) were measured by ELISA. Gene expression in tumor 
      tissues was measured by the nCounter PanCancer Pathways Panel. Pharmacodynamic 
      changes in serum biomarker levels from baseline, and associations of clinical 
      outcomes with baseline biomarker levels, were evaluated. RESULTS: Four hundred 
      and seven patients were included in the serum analysis set (lenvatinib n = 279, 
      sorafenib n = 128); 58 patients were included in the gene-expression analysis set 
      (lenvatinib n = 34, sorafenib n = 24). Both treatments were associated with 
      increases in VEGF; only lenvatinib was associated with increases in FGF19 and 
      FGF23 at all time points. Lenvatinib-treated responders had greater increases in 
      FGF19 and FGF23 versus nonresponders at cycle 4, day 1 (FGF19: 55.2% vs. 18.3%, P 
      = 0.014; FGF23: 48.4% vs. 16.4%, P = 0.0022, respectively). Higher baseline VEGF, 
      ANG2, and FGF21 correlated with shorter OS in both treatment groups. OS was 
      longer for lenvatinib than sorafenib [median, 10.9 vs. 6.8 months, respectively; 
      HR, 0.53; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.33-0.85; P-interaction = 0.0397] with 
      higher baseline FGF21. In tumor tissue biomarker analysis, VEGF/FGF-enriched 
      groups showed improved OS with lenvatinib versus the intermediate VEGF/FGF group 
      (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.16-0.91; P = 0.0253). CONCLUSIONS: Higher baseline levels of 
      VEGF, FGF21, and ANG2 may be prognostic for shorter OS. Higher baseline FGF21 may 
      be predictive for longer OS with lenvatinib compared with sorafenib, but this 
      needs confirmation.

TI  - Sorafenib and omacetaxine mepesuccinate as a safe and effective treatment for 
      acute myeloid leukemia carrying internal tandem duplication of Fms-like tyrosine 
      kinase 3.
PG  - 344-353
LID - 10.1002/cncr.32534 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (OME) has antileukemic effects against 
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) carrying an internal tandem duplication of Fms-like 
      tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD). A phase 2 clinical trial was conducted to evaluate 
      a combination treatment of sorafenib and omacetaxine mepesuccinate (SOME). 
      METHODS: Relapsed or refractory (R/R) or newly diagnosed patients were treated 
      with sorafenib (200-400 mg twice daily) and OME (2 mg daily) for 7 (first course) 
      or 5 days (second course onward) every 21 days until disease progression or 
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The primary endpoint 
      was composite complete remission, which was defined as complete remission (CR) 
      plus complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi). Secondary 
      endpoints were leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: 
      Thirty-nine R/R patients and 5 newly diagnosed patients were recruited. Among the 
      R/R patients, 28 achieved CR or CRi. Two patients showed partial remission, and 9 
      patients did not respond. Among the 5 newly diagnosed patients, 4 achieved CR, 
      and 1 achieved CRi. The median LFS and OS were 5.6 and 10.9 months, respectively. 
      Prior Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitor exposure (P = .007), 2 or more 
      inductions (P = .001), and coexisting IDH2 (P = .008) and RUNX1 mutations 
      (P = .003) were associated with lower CR/CRi rates. HSCT consolidation and deep 
      molecular responses (defined as an FLT3-ITD variant allelic frequency [VAF] ≤ 
      0.1% or a nucleophosmin 1 [NPM1] mutant VAF ≤ 0.01%) were associated with better 
      OS and LFS. Prior FLT3 inhibitor exposure and 2 or more inductions were 
      associated with inferior LFS. CONCLUSIONS: SOME was safe and effective for R/R 
      and newly diagnosed FLT3-ITD AML.

AB  - Dysregulation of the tyrosine kinase signaling pathway is closely related to 
      tumor development, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are important targets for 
      potential anticancer strategies. In particular, sorafenib, as a representative 
      drug of multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitors, has an important clinical status 
      and is widely used for treating various solid tumors and diabetic complications. 
      However, poor aqueous solubility of sorafenib, poor bioavailability of commonly 
      used oral dose forms, poor accumulation at tumor sites, and severe off-target 
      effects that tend to induce intolerable systemic side effects in patients have 
      greatly reduced its therapeutic efficiency and limited its extensive clinical 
      application. To improve the properties of sorafenib, increase the efficiency of 
      clinical treatment, and overcome the increasingly prominent phenomenon of 
      sorafenib resistance, multiple investigations have been conducted. Numerous 
      studies have reported that the properties of nanomaterials, such as small 
      particle size, large specific surface area, high surface activity and high 
      adsorption capacity, make nanotechnology promising for the construction of ideal 
      sorafenib nanodelivery systems to achieve timed and targeted delivery of 
      sorafenib to tumors, prolong the blood circulation time of the drug, improve the 
      utilization efficiency of the drug and reduce systemic toxic side effects. This 
      review summarizes the progress of research applications in nanotechnology related 
      to sorafenib, discusses the current problems, and expresses expectations for the 
      prospect of clinical applications of sorafenib with improved performance.

TI  - Inhibitory effects of Thai herbal extracts on the cytochrome P450 3A-mediated the 
      metabolism of gefitinib, lapatinib and sorafenib.

AB  - Herbal products are widely used in cancer patients via co-administration with 
      chemotherapy. Previous studies have demonstrated that pharmacokinetic 
      interactions between herbs and anticancer drugs exist due to inhibition of 
      drug-metabolizing enzymes, particularly cytochrome P450s (CYPs). The aim of this 
      study was to determine the inhibitory effects of Andrographis paniculata, Curcuma 
      zedoaria, Ganoderma lucidum, Murdannia loriformis and Ventilago denticulata 
      extracts on the metabolism of gefitinib, lapatinib and sorafenib. The activities 
      of CYP3A in human liver microsome on the metabolism of gefitinib, lapatinib and 
      sorafenib in the absence and presence of Thai herbal extracts were assayed using 
      high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Curcuma zedoaria extract 
      potently inhibited CYP3A-mediated lapatinib and sorafenib metabolism with IC(50) 
      values of 4.18 ± 3.20 and 7.59 ± 1.23 μg/mL, respectively, while the metabolism 
      of gefitinib was strongly inhibited by Murdannia loriformis and Ventilago 
      denticulata extracts with IC(50) values of 7.53 ± 2.87 and 7.06 ± 1.23 μg/mL, 
      respectively. Andrographis paniculata and Ganoderma lucidum extracts had less 
      effect on the metabolism of the tested anticancers (IC(50) values >10 μg/mL). In 
      addition, kinetic analysis of the ability of Curcuma zedoaria extract to inhibit 
      CYP3A-mediated metabolism of anticancer drugs was best described by the 
      noncompetitive and competitive inhibition models with K(i) values of 20.08 and 
      11.55 μg/mL for the metabolism of gefitinib and sorafenib, respectively. The 
      present study demonstrated that there were potential pharmacokinetic interactions 
      between tyrosine kinase inhibitors and herbal extracts.

TI  - OATP1B1 Plays an Important Role in the Transport and Treatment Efficacy of 
      Sorafenib in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 9711179

LID - 9711179
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib is an anticancer drug used in the treatment of unresectable 
      hepatocellular carcinoma and advanced renal cell carcinoma. It is a substrate for 
      the human OATP1B1. This study is aimed at assessing the role of OATP1B1 in 
      transportation and uptake of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma and how 
      OATP1B1 affects the pharmacodynamics of sorafenib in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: 
      Sorafenib transport was measured in HepG2, HepG2-OATP1B1∗1a, HepG2-OATP1B1∗1b, 
      HepG2-OATP1B1∗15, LO2, LO2-OATP1B1∗1a, LO2-OATP1B1∗1b, and LO2-OATP1B1∗15 cells, 
      as well as in HepG2 cells transfected with miR-148a mimics. The viability and 
      apoptosis rate of cells treated with sorafenib were evaluated. A liver cancer rat 
      model was established to explore the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 
      sorafenib after overexpression of Oatp2. RESULTS: Changes in expression and 
      genetic mutations of OATP1B1 significantly affected the uptake of sorafenib in 
      HepG2 and LO2 transgenic cells, and the uptake of sorafenib was higher in HepG2 
      than LO2. Genetic mutations of OATP1B1 significantly affected the cell viability 
      and apoptosis rate of HepG2 cells after sorafenib treatment. Compared to control 
      group, the uptake of sorafenib in miR-148a mimic-transfected HepG2 cells was 
      decreased, and the cell viability was increased. PCN significantly increased the 
      expression of Oatp2 and affected the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib. Vascular 
      endothelial growth factor levels and microvascular density in tumor-adjacent 
      tissues decreased significantly, suggesting that increased Oatp2 expression 
      improves the treatment effect of sorafenib in a rat model of liver cancer. 
      CONCLUSIONS: OATP1B1 plays an important role in the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma.

TI  - Phase I Study Evaluating Dose De-escalation of Sorafenib with Metformin and 
      Atorvastatin in Hepatocellular Carcinoma (SMASH).
PG  - 165-e222
LID - 10.1093/oncolo/oyab008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This phase I dose de-escalation study aimed to assess the 
      tolerability, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of sequentially 
      decreasing doses of sorafenib in combination (SAM) with atorvastatin (A, 10 mg) 
      and metformin (M, 500 mg BD) in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC). METHODS: Patients were enrolled in 1 of 4 sequential cohorts (10 patients 
      each) of sorafenib doses (800 mg, 600 mg. 400 mg, and 200 mg) with A and M. 
      Progression from one level to the next was based on prespecified minimum disease 
      stabilization (at least 4/10) and upper limits of specific grade 3-5 
      treatment-related adverse events (TRAE). RESULTS: The study was able to progress 
      through all 4 dosing levels of sorafenib by the accrual of 40 patients. 
      Thirty-eight (95%) patients had either main portal vein thrombosis or/and 
      extra-hepatic disease. The most common grade 3-5 TRAEs were hand-foot-syndrome 
      (grade 2 and grade 3) in 3 (8%) and transaminitis in 2 (5%) patients, 
      respectively. The plasma concentrations of sorafenib peaked at 600 mg dose, and 
      the concentration threshold of 2400 ng/mL was associated with higher odds of 
      achieving time to exposure (TTE) concentrations >75% centile (odds ratio [OR] = 
      10.0 [1.67-44.93]; P = .01). The median overall survival for patients without 
      early hepatic decompensation (n = 31) was 8.9 months (95% confidence interval 
      [CI]: 3.2-14.5 months). CONCLUSION: The SAM combination in HCC patients with 
      predominantly unfavorable baseline disease characteristics showed a marked 
      reduction in sorafenib-related side effects. Studies using sorafenib 600 mg per 
      day in this combination along with sorafenib drug level monitoring can be 
      evaluated in further trials.(Trial ID: CTRI/2018/07/014865).

TI  - Role of human CYP3A4 in the biotransformation of sorafenib to its major oxidized 
      metabolites.

AB  - The tyrosine kinase inhibitor drug sorafenib is used in the treatment of liver 
      and renal cancers but adverse effects may necessitate dose interruption and 
      under-dosage may lead to therapeutic failure. Sorafenib also undergoes cytochrome 
      P450 (CYP)-dependent biotransformation to the N-oxide and other metabolites. 
      However, although CYPs are major determinants of efficacy and toxicity the roles 
      of these enzymes in the formation of multiple sorafenib metabolites are unclear. 
      In the present study CYP-mediated pathways of sorafenib oxidation in human liver 
      were evaluated. cDNA-expressed CYP3A4 was the major catalyst in the formation of 
      the principal N-oxide and N-hydroxymethyl metabolites of sorafenib, as well as 
      the minor N-desmethyl metabolite. In contrast, CYP3A5 exhibited only ~5% of the 
      activity of CYP3A4 and eleven other CYPs and three flavin-containing 
      monooxygenases were inactive. In human hepatic microsomes metabolite formation 
      was correlated with CYP3A4-mediated midazolam 1'-hydroxylation, but not with 
      other CYP-specific substrate oxidations. In accord with these findings the CYP3A4 
      inhibitor ketoconazole selectively inhibited microsomal sorafenib oxidation 
      pathways. From computational modeling studies atoms in the structure of sorafenib 
      that undergo biotransformation were within ~5.4 Å of the CYP3A4 heme. Important 
      hydrogen bonding interactions between sorafenib and amino acids Ser-119 and 
      Glu-374 in the active center of CYP3A4 were identified. These findings indicate 
      that sorafenib is oxidized selectively by human CYP3A4. This information could be 
      adapted in individualized approaches to optimize sorafenib safety and efficacy in 
      cancer patients.

TI  - Co-delivery of sorafenib and metapristone encapsulated by CXCR4-targeted PLGA-PEG 
      nanoparticles overcomes hepatocellular carcinoma resistance to sorafenib.
PG  - 232
LID - 10.1186/s13046-019-1216-x [doi]
LID - 232
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib is approved as a standard therapy for advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its clinical application is limited due to 
      moderate therapeutic efficacy and high incidence of acquired resistance resulted 
      from elevated levels of SDF-1/CXCR4 axis induced by prolonged sorafenib 
      treatment. We previously demonstrated metapristone (RU486 metabolite) as a cancer 
      metastatic chemopreventive agent targeting SDF-1/CXCR4 axis. Therefore, we 
      hypothesized that combining sorafenib with metapristone could synergistically 
      suppress cell proliferation, enhance anti-cancer activity and repress potential 
      drug resistance. METHODS: Changes in cellular CXCR4 expression by metapristone 
      were analyzed by RT-PCR and western blotting. Effect of combining sorafenib with 
      metapristone on cell viability was examined by MTT assay; combination index value 
      was calculated to evaluate the synergistic effect of combined therapy. To 
      overcome poor pharmacokinetics and reduce off-target toxicity, CXCR4-targeted 
      nanoparticles (NPs) were developed to co-deliver sorafenib and metapristone into 
      CXCR4-expressing HCC in vitro and in vivo; cell proliferation, colony formation 
      and apoptosis assays were conducted; nude mice bearing HCC xenograft were used to 
      examine effects of this therapeutic approach on HCC progression. RESULTS: Here we 
      showed metapristone significantly reduced CXCR4 expression in HCC. Combinatory 
      chemotherapy of sorafenib with metapristone synergistically suppressed HCC 
      proliferation and resistance. CXCR4-targeted PEGylated poly (lactic-co-glycolic 
      acid) NPs conjugated with LFC131 (a peptide inhibitor of CXCR4), could deliver 
      more sorafenib and metapristone into HCC via specific recognition and binding 
      with transmembrane CXCR4, and resulted in the enhanced cytotoxicity, colony 
      inhibition and apoptosis by regulating more Akt/ERK/p38 MAPK/caspase signaling 
      pathways. Co-delivery of sorafenib with metapristone by the LFC131-conjugated NPs 
      showed prolonged circulation and target accumulation at tumor sites, and thus 
      suppressed tumor growth in a tumor xenograft model. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, 
      co-delivery of sorafenib and metapristone via the CXCR4-targeted NPs displays a 
      synergistic therapy against HCC. Our results suggest combinational treatment of 
      chemotherapeutics offer an effective strategy for enhancing the therapeutic 
      efficacy on carcinoma, and highlight the potential application of ligand-modified 
      tumor-targeting nanocarriers in delivering drugs as a promising cancer 
      therapeutic approach.

TI  - Sorafenib N-Oxide Is an Inhibitor of Human Hepatic CYP3A4.
PG  - 15
LID - 10.1208/s12248-018-0262-1 [doi]
AB  - The multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib (SOR) is clinically important in the 
      treatment of hepatocellular and renal cancers and undergoes CYP3A4-dependent 
      oxidation in liver to the pharmacologically active N-oxide metabolite (SNO). 
      There have been reports that kinase inhibitors such as SOR may precipitate 
      pharmacokinetic interactions with coadministered drugs that compete for 
      CYP3A4-mediated biotransformation, but these occur non-uniformly in patients. 
      Clinical evidence also indicates that SNO accumulates in serum of some patients 
      during prolonged SOR therapy. In this study undertaken in hepatic microsomes from 
      individual donors, we assessed the possibility that SNO might contribute to 
      pharmacokinetic interactions mediated by SOR. Enzyme kinetics of CYP3A4-mediated 
      midazolam 1'-hydroxylation in individual human hepatic microsomes were analyzed 
      by non-linear regression and appropriate replots. Thus, SNO and SOR were 
      linear-mixed inhibitors of microsomal CYP3A4 activity (K(i)s 15 ± 4 and 
      33 ± 14 μM, respectively). To assess these findings, further molecular docking 
      studies of SOR and SNO with the 1TQN crystal structure of CYP3A4 were undertaken. 
      SNO elicited a larger number of interactions with key amino acid residues located 
      in substrate recognition sequences of the enzyme. In the optimal docking pose, 
      the N-oxide moiety of SNO was also found to interact directly with the heme 
      moiety of CYP3A4. These findings suggest that SNO could contribute to 
      pharmacokinetic interactions involving SOR, perhaps in individuals who produce 
      high circulating concentrations of the metabolite.

TI  - Development and validation of an HPLC-UV method for sorafenib quantification in 
      human plasma and application to patients with cancer in routine clinical 
      practice.
PG  - 317-25
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0000000000000027 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several factors such as low therapeutic index, large interindividual 
      variability in systemic exposure, and the relationships between exposure and 
      toxicity for sorafenib could justify its therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). To 
      support TDM, a selective and precise high-performance liquid chromatography with 
      ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) method was developed and validated for the 
      determination of sorafenib in human plasma. METHODS: After protein precipitation 
      with acetonitrile, sorafenib and lapatinib (internal standard) were separated 
      using isocratic elution on a Kromasil C18 column using a mobile phase of 
      acetonitrile and 20 mmol/L ammonium acetate in a proportion 53:47 (vol/vol) 
      pumped at a constant flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. Quantification was performed at 260 
      nm. Validation experiments were carried out after the guidelines for 
      Bioanalytical Method Validation published by the Food and Drug Administration and 
      the European Medicines Agency. RESULTS: Calibration curves were linear over the 
      range 0.1-20 mcg/mL. Inter- and intra-day coefficients of variation were <3%. The 
      limit of detection and the lower limit of quantification were 0.06 and 0.1 
      mcg/mL, respectively. Recoveries of sorafenib from plasma were >99% in all cases. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This method was successfully applied to the determination of the 
      drug in the plasma of 2 patients with cancer receiving sorafenib 200 and 400 mg 
      orally twice daily, respectively, and could be useful for TDM of sorafenib in 
      routine clinical practice.

AB  - Orally delivered molecularly targeted small-molecule drugs play a significant 
      role in managing cancer as a chronic disease. However, due to the poor oral 
      bioavailability of some of these molecules, high-dose administration is required 
      leading to dose-limiting toxicity especially when delivered daily for a long 
      duration. Here, we report an oral nanoformulation for small-molecule multi-kinase 
      inhibitor, sorafenib tosylate, showing nearly two fold enhancement in the oral 
      bioavailability and enhanced therapeutic efficacy with a better safety profile 
      compared to the current clinical formulation. Using a scalable process involving 
      high-pressure homogenization, sorafenib was loaded into an albumin nanocarrier 
      at ~ 50 w/w%. Repeated preparation of gram-scale batches (n = 7) showed an 
      average particle size of 180 ± 9 nm, encapsulation efficiency of 95 [Formula: see 
      text] 2%, and drug-loading efficiency of 48 [Formula: see text] 0.7%. Further, 
      surface engineering with a mucoadhesive layer on nanoparticles (referred to as 
      ABSORF) resulted in the final size of 299 ± 38 nm and surface charge 
      of -54 ± 8 mV. Single-dose and multidose pharmacokinetic studies showed two fold 
      enhancement in the plasma concentration of sorafenib compared to current 
      clinically used tablets. Antitumor efficacy studies in the orthotopic rat liver 
      tumor model showed significant tumor regression (p value = 0.0037) even at half 
      dose (eqv. to 200 mg of human equivalent dose) of ABSORF compared to clinical 
      control (eqv. to 400 mg). The biodistribution of sorafenib from ABSORF was higher 
      in the liver; however, liver and kidney function test parameters were comparable 
      with that of the 2 × dose of clinical control. No abnormalities and signs of 
      toxicity were seen in the histopathological analysis for ABSORF-treated animals. 
      In summary, we demonstrate a scalable preparation of small-molecule drug-loaded 
      nanoformulation with approximately two fold enhancement in oral bioavailability, 
      improved antitumor efficacy, and acceptable toxicity profile.

TI  - Transporter-Mediated Interaction Between Platinum Drugs and Sorafenib at the 
      Cellular Level.
PG  - 9
LID - 10.1208/s12248-017-0169-2 [doi]
AB  - Combining the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib with the platinum-based 
      chemotherapy of solid tumors was expected to improve treatment outcome. However, 
      in many clinical trials, no benefit from sorafenib addition to the 
      platinum-containing regimen could be demonstrated. Moreover, in some studies, 
      decreased survival of ovarian cancer patients as well as non-small cell lung 
      cancer patients with squamous cell histology was observed. The aim of this study 
      was to investigate the cellular mechanisms of the pharmacological interaction 
      between platinum drugs and sorafenib in different cancer cell lines. The 
      interaction was characterized by combination index analysis, platinum 
      accumulation and DNA platination were determined using flameless atomic 
      absorption spectrometry, and protein expression was assessed with Western blot. 
      In the sensitive A2780 ovarian carcinoma and H520 squamous cell lung carcinoma 
      cell lines, sorafenib induced downregulation of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase. In A2780 
      cells, the kinase inhibitor also decreased the expression of copper transporter 1 
      (CTR1). As a result, sorafenib treatment led to a diminished cellular 
      accumulation of cisplatin and carboplatin and to a decrease in DNA platination in 
      these cell lines. This was not the case in the cisplatin-resistant A2780cis 
      ovarian carcinoma and H522 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines featuring lower basal 
      expression of the above-mentioned transporters. In all cell lines studied, an 
      antagonistic interaction between platinum drugs and sorafenib was found. Our 
      results suggest that sorafenib impairs cisplatin and carboplatin uptake through 
      downregulation of CTR1 and/or Na(+),K(+)-ATPase resulting in reduction of DNA 
      platination. This effect is not observed in cancer cells with defects in platinum 
      accumulation.

AB  - Sorafenib (Nexavar) is a targeted therapy acting as VEGFR and PDGFR 
      tyrosine-kinase inhibitor that has been approved in France in the treatment of 
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma and hepatocarcinoma. Hand-foot syndrome is one of 
      the more frequent toxicity related to sorafenib. This paper up lights the main 
      points concerning this toxicity in the view of specialists working together in 
      the care of these patients: a pharmacologist, a dermatologist and a medical 
      oncologist. The clinic and symptoms of hand-foot syndrome as the biological 
      interpretation, the symptomatic treatment and the impact on the specific 
      treatment of sorafenib are developed.

TI  - A simple and fast LC-MS/MS method for the routine measurement of cabozantinib,

      metabolite in human plasma.

AB  - Targeted therapies such as cabozantinib (CABO), pazopanib (PAZO), sorafenib 
      (SORA), sunitinib (SUNI) and its main active metabolite N-desethyl-sunitinib 
      (DST-SUNI), olaparib (OLA) and palbociclib (PALBO) display large pharmacokinetics 
      variability impacting their responses in terms of efficacy or toxicity. For the 
      monitoring of these drugs, an analytical method allowing to routinely measure 
      their concentrations in human plasma is needed. Such a method has been developed 
      and validated and is presented here. The chromatographic separation is achieved 
      on a Zorbax Bonus-RP analytical column using an isocratic elution of 92% V/V of 
      acetonitrile and 8% of water in 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 500 µl/min for 
      0.5 min and then 300 µl/min for 2 min. After a liquid-liquid extraction of plasma 
      samples, a step of filtration is performed. This method was validated based on 
      the EMA and French committee of accreditation guidelines. The analysis time is 
      2.5 min per run, and all analytes eluted within 0.53-1.61 min. The standard 
      curves are linear over the range from 1 to 380 ng/ml for SUNI; from 4.3 to 
      450 ng/ml for DST-SUNI; from 6 to 1000 ng/ml for PALBO; from 75 to 5000 ng/ml for 
      CABO, from 0.17 to 20 µg/ml for OLA; from 0.35 to 40 µg/ml for SORA and from 1.7 
      to 200 µg/ml for PAZO. The method also showed satisfactory results in terms 
      precision (below 9.5% for within-run and below 13% for between-run) and accuracy 
      (below 13.5% for within-run and below 14% for between-run). After sampling, all 
      the compounds are stable in whole blood at ambient temperature at least for 6 h 
      and plasma are stable for 48 h at ambient temperature or 4 °C. The method 
      presented here allows to measure the concentrations of 7 targeted therapies in a 
      routine setting. We moreover present here a method that is, to our knowledge, one 
      of the first detailed method aimed at the measurement of palbociclib in human 
      plasma in a routine setting, together with data useful for the management of 
      samples in routine hospital practice.

      drug-related adverse events of sorafenib. METHODS: Ten patients with metastatic 
      renal cell carcinoma undergoing hemodialysis received sorafenib. Initial dose was 
      200 mg once daily, and the dose was increased up to the maintenance dose of 200 
      mg twice daily. The pharmacokinetic study was performed after a steady state was 
      reached with 200 mg twice daily in six patients. RESULTS: Complete response 
      occurred in one patient, partial response in three, stable disease in four and 
      progressive disease in two. Median progression-free survival was 6.3 months. 
      Serious adverse events were found in nine patients, including a Grade 5 
      subarachnoid hemorrhage and a Grade 4 cerebellar hemorrhage. In the 
      pharmacokinetic study, the geometric mean of maximum concentration and area under 
      the curve from 0 to 10 h of plasma concentration were similar on the day of 
      hemodialysis and the day off hemodialysis. These data were lower than those from 
      Japanese people with healthy kidneys and normal kidney function. There was no 
      association between objective response or the occurrence of serious adverse 
      events and pharmacokinetic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with sorafenib of 
      patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma undergoing hemodialysis appears to 
      be feasible, but we express some concern about the higher incidence of serious 
      adverse events even with the reduced dose. However, clinical efficacy was not 
      compromised.

TI  - Design And Characterisation Of Novel Sorafenib-Loaded Carbon Nanotubes With 
      Distinct Tumour-Suppressive Activity In Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 8445-8467
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S223920 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Over the past 30 years, no consistent survival benefits have been 
      recorded for anticancer agents of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), except 
      for the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib (Nexavar(®)), which clinically achieves 
      only ~3 months overall survival benefit. This modest benefit is attributed to 
      limited aqueous solubility, slow dissolution rate and, consequently, limited 
      absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Thus, novel formulation modalities 
      are in demand to improve the bioavailability of the drug to attack HCC in a more 
      efficient manner. In the current study, we aimed to design a novel 
      sorafenib-loaded carbon nanotubes (CNTs) formula that is able to improve the 
      therapeutic efficacy of carried cargo against HCC and subsequently investigate 
      the antitumour activity of this formula. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sorafenib was 
      loaded on functionalized CNTs through physical adsorption, and an alginate-based 
      method was subsequently applied to microcapsulate the drug-loaded CNTs 
      (CNTs-SFN). The therapeutic efficacy of the new formula was estimated and 
      compared to that of conventional sorafenib, both in vitro (against HepG2 cells) 
      and in vivo (in a DENA-induced HCC rat model). RESULTS: The in vitro MTT 
      anti-proliferative assay revealed that the drug-loaded CNTs formula was at least 
      two-fold more cytotoxic towards HepG2 cells than was sorafenib itself. Moreover, 
      the in vivo animal experiments proved that our innovative formula was superior to 
      conventional sorafenib at all assessed end points. Circulating AFP-L3% was 
      significantly decreased in the CNTs-SFN-MCs-treated group (14.0%) in comparison 
      to that of the DENA (40.3%) and sorafenib (38.8%) groups. This superiority was 
      further confirmed by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence assessment of 
      some HCC-relevant biomarkers. CONCLUSION: Our results firmly suggest the 
      distinctive cancer-suppressive nature of CNTs-SFN-MCs, both against HepG2 cells 
      in vitro and in a DENA-induced HCC rat model in vivo, with a preferential 
      superiority over conventional sorafenib.

TI  - Phase I study of sorafenib and tipifarnib for recurrent glioblastoma: NABTC

PG  - 79-86

AB  - Recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) has a very low 6-month progression free survival 
      (PFS) with currently available treatments. Combination chemotherapy to target 
      multiple cell signaling pathways is currently being investigated in order to 
      improve prognosis for recurrent disease. The purpose of this phase I study was to 
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the combination of tipifarnib and 
      sorafenib for the treatment of recurrent GBM. Patients with pathologically proven 
      WHO grade IV GBM and radiographically proven tumor recurrence were eligible for 
      this study. Treatments included sorafenib at twice daily and escalating dosages 
      of tipifarnib. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was determined over the first 28-days 
      of treatments, and the MTD was determined in a 3 + 3 study design. We enrolled 24 
      patients, and 21 patients completed the MTD period. The study was stopped early 
      with no MTD determination for excessive toxicities. The last dose level reached 
      was sorafenib at 200 mg twice a day and tipifarnib 100 mg twice a day on an 
      alternating week schedule. The DLTs included diarrhea, lipase elevation, 
      hypophosphatemia, and arthralgia. The combination of sorafenib and tipifarnib has 
      excessive toxicities and full single agent dosages could not be achieved in 
      combination.

TI  - Sorafenib and cisplatin/doxorubicin (PLADO) in pediatric hepatocellular 
      carcinoma.
PG  - 539-44
LID - 10.1002/pbc.23295 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Overall survival is poor in children with primary unresectable 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Sorafenib has been shown to significantly improve 
      progression-free survival in adult hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. We 
      evaluated the experience of PLADO (cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) /day, doxorubicin 
      2 × 30 mg/m(2) /day) in combination with sorafenib in pediatric HCC patients. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical data of 12 patients (7-16 years), 7 with 
      unresectable tumor, were retrospectively assessed. RESULTS: In total 6/12 (50%) 
      patients are in complete remission after a median follow-up of 20 months (4 with 
      PLADO/sorafenib/resection, 2 with liver transplantation after local relapse). Of 
      the seven patients with unresectable tumor, PLADO/sorafenib resulted in partial 
      response (PR) in four, stable disease (SD) in two, and progression in one. Three 
      are alive in CR after complete resection after 12 (alternative therapy after two 
      cycles PLADO/sorafenib), 12 and 18 months (six cycles PLADO/sorafenib), 
      respectively. All four patients with elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels had a 
      marked drop after two cycles. Of the five patients with primary complete tumor 
      resection one is alive disease-free at 27 months. Four had local or metastatic 
      relapses (13, 7, 12, and 13 months), two of whom were rescued by liver 
      transplantation (CR after 25 and 32 months). The main toxicity attributable to 
      sorafenib was a hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) in seven patients. CONCLUSION: 
      Sorafenib in combination with PLADO may be a promising approach in pediatric HCC; 
      HFSR was the most important toxicity. Data based on prospective studies are 
      needed to evaluate pharmacokinetics, resectability rates, and survival in 
      pediatric HCC treated with sorafenib.

TI  - Elucidating the Molecular Basis of Sorafenib Resistance in HCC: Current Findings 
      and Future Directions.
PG  - 741-757
LID - 10.2147/JHC.S285726 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related 
      mortality worldwide. Sorafenib is the first multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
      approved for HCC and it has represented the standard of care for advanced HCC for 
      almost 10 years, offering a survival benefit when compared to placebo. However, 
      this benefit is limited, showing rare objective responses and a disease control 
      rate approaching 50-60%, with most patients experiencing disease progression at 6 
      months. These scant results dictate the urgent need for strategies to overcome 
      both primary and acquired resistance. Herein we report several mechanisms 
      supporting resistance to sorafenib in HCC patients, including activation of 
      oncogenic pathways. Among these, the AKT/mTOR pathway plays a crucial role being 
      at the crossroad of multiple driving events. Autophagy, multidrug-resistant 
      phenotype, hypoxia-related mechanisms and endoplasmic reticulum stress are 
      gaining more and more relevance as crucial events driving the response to 
      anticancer drugs, including sorafenib. Several HCC-specific miRNAs take part to 
      the regulation of these cellular processes. Remarkably, molecularly targeted 
      strategies able to overcome resistance in these settings have also been reported. 
      So far, the vast majority of data has been derived from laboratory studies, which 
      means the need for an extensive validation. Indeed, most of the possible drug 
      associations displaying promising effects in improving sorafenib efficacy herein 
      described derive from preclinical explorations. Notably, data obtained in animal 
      models can be inconsistent with regard to the human disease for efficacy, safety, 
      side effects, best formulation and pharmacokinetics. However, they represent the 
      necessary preliminary step to improve the management of advanced HCC.

TI  - Ramucirumab for Patients with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Elevated 
      Alpha Fetoprotein Following Non-Sorafenib Systemic Therapy: An Expansion Cohort 
      of REACH-2.
PG  - e938-e948
LID - 10.1093/oncolo/oyac183 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ramucirumab is indicated for patients with advanced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) and α-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥400 ng/mL following sorafenib. Here, we 
      prospectively studied ramucirumab following non-sorafenib systemic therapies. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This open-label, non-comparative cohort of REACH-2 
      enrolled patients with advanced HCC, Child-Pugh class-A liver disease, and AFP 
      ≥400 ng/mL who had received 1-2 lines of therapy, excluding sorafenib or 
      chemotherapy. Ramucirumab was administered 8 mg/kg intravenously Q2W. The primary 
      endpoint was safety. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free 
      survival, objective response rate (RECIST v1.1), time to progression, 
      pharmacokinetics, and patient-reported outcomes. Final analysis occurred after 
      all enrolled patients completed ≥3 treatment cycles or discontinued treatment. 
      RESULTS: Between April 27, 2018, and March 29, 2021, 47 patients were treated at 
      21 investigative sites in Asia, Europe, and USA. The most frequently reported 
      grade ≥3 adverse events, regardless of causality, were hypertension (11%), 
      proteinuria (6%), hyponatremia (6%), and AST increased (6%). Two patients died 
      from adverse events (myocardial infarction and upper gastrointestinal 
      hemorrhage), deemed related to treatment. Median progression-free survival, time 
      to progression, and overall survival were 1.7 months, 2.8 months, and 8.7 months, 
      respectively. The objective response rate was 10.6% with a median duration 
      response of 8.3 months. Median time to deterioration in FHSI-8 total score was 
      4.4 months. CONCLUSION: Ramucirumab demonstrated consistent and meaningful 
      clinical activity with no new safety signals following non-sorafenib therapies in 
      patients with advanced HCC and AFP ≥400 ng/mL. This represents one of the first 
      sequencing studies for patients with advanced HCC not treated with sorafenib.

TI  - Proposal of a prediction model describing the metabolic interaction between 
      warfarin and sorafenib using a population pharmacokinetic approach.
PG  - 202-215
LID - 10.5414/CP203826 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We attempted to examine the applicability of a population 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model describing the metabolic 
      interaction between warfarin and sorafenib due to CYP2C9 inhibition and to 
      predict the plasma concentrations of sorafenib and S-warfarin, the international 
      normalized ratio (INR), and the optimal maintenance dose of warfarin in the 
      presence of sorafenib in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sorafenib inhibition 
      constant for S-warfarin metabolism was determined in vitro, and the unbound 
      fraction in the liver was estimated using the published equations. A population 
      PK-PD model describing the interaction between warfarin and sorafenib assuming 
      competitive metabolic inhibition of S-warfarin by sorafenib was developed using 
      NONMEM. The model was evaluated using clinical data and INR collected from the 
      literature. RESULTS: The observed time courses of INR retrieved from Japanese and 
      Caucasian patients given warfarin and sorafenib were mostly within the 90% range 
      of the predicted values. Then, we predicted the plasma sorafenib and S-warfarin 
      concentrations and INR after administration of warfarin (3 mg/day) alone and 
      warfarin + sorafenib (800 mg/day). The predicted mean plasma S-warfarin 
      concentration and INR at steady state were almost 6 and 2 times greater, 
      respectively, in the presence of sorafenib than those for warfarin alone. The 
      predicted S-warfarin concentrations and INR after reduction of the warfarin dose 
      (0.5 mg/day) in the presence of sorafenib were comparable to those after 3 mg/day 
      warfarin alone. CONCLUSION: The proposed population PK-PD model has the potential 
      to predict an increase in INR quantitatively after concurrent administration of 
      warfarin and sorafenib.

TI  - Sorafenib is an inhibitor of UGT1A1 but is metabolized by UGT1A9: implications of 
      genetic variants on pharmacokinetics and hyperbilirubinemia.
PG  - 2099-107
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2484 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Several case reports suggest sorafenib exposure and sorafenib-induced 
      hyperbilirubinemia may be related to a (TA)(5/6/7) repeat polymorphism in 
      UGT1A1*28 (UGT, uridine glucuronosyl transferase). We hypothesized that sorafenib 
      inhibits UGT1A1 and individuals carrying UGT1A1*28 and/or UGT1A9 variants 
      experience greater sorafenib exposure and greater increase in sorafenib-induced 
      plasma bilirubin concentration. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Inhibition of 
      UGT1A1-mediated bilirubin glucuronidation by sorafenib was assessed in vitro. 
      UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A9*3 genotypes were ascertained with fragment analysis or 
      direct sequencing in 120 cancer patients receiving sorafenib on five different 
      clinical trials. Total bilirubin measurements were collected in prostate cancer 
      patients before receiving sorafenib (n = 41) and 19 to 30 days following 
      treatment and were compared with UGT1A1*28 genotype. RESULTS: Sorafenib exhibited 
      mixed-mode inhibition of UGT1A1-mediated bilirubin glucuronidation (IC(50) = 18 
      μmol/L; K(i) = 11.7 μmol/L) in vitro. Five patients carrying UGT1A1*28/*28 (n = 
      4) or UGT1A9*3/*3 (n = 1) genotypes had first dose, dose-normalized areas under 
      the sorafenib plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) that were in the 93rd 
      percentile, whereas three patients carrying UGT1A1*28/*28 had AUCs in the bottom 
      quartile of all genotyped patients. The Drug Metabolizing Enzymes and 
      Transporters genotyping platform was applied to DNA obtained from six patients, 
      which revealed the ABCC2-24C>T genotype cosegregated with sorafenib AUC 
      phenotype. Sorafenib exposure was related to plasma bilirubin increases in 
      patients carrying 1 or 2 copies of UGT1A1*28 alleles (n = 12 and n = 5; R(2) = 
      0.38 and R(2) = 0.77; P = 0.032 and P = 0.051, respectively). UGT1A1*28 carriers 
      showed two distinct phenotypes that could be explained by ABCC2-24C>T genotype 
      and are more likely to experience plasma bilirubin increases following sorafenib 
      if they had high sorafenib exposure. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study indicates that 
      genotype status of UGT1A1, UGT1A9, and ABCC2 and serum bilirubin concentration 
      increases reflect abnormally high AUC in patients treated with sorafenib.

AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib is recommended for therapy of advanced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. Preclinical data indicate a relation between 
      dose and antitumor efficacy. In clinical trials, adverse events improve after 
      dose reduction suggesting a dose-dependent toxicity. Given dose has a direct 
      impact on the drug serum concentration, but the latter also can be influenced by 
      multiple factors, including interaction and metabolisation. To enable the 
      investigation of concentration-related effects, an easy and sensitive assay for 
      sorafenib drug monitoring is essential. METHODS: A high-performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC) analysis involving an extraction with diethyl ether 
      followed by separation on a Pinnacle™ DB C18 column and quantitation by UV 
      absorbance at 260 nm was established. Sorafenib concentrations in samples of 
      serum and peritoneal fluid have been determined. RESULTS: The assay was validated 
      for serum samples and is linear over the concentration range of 100-5,000 ng/ml 
      with a determination coefficient of >0.999. The limit of detection is 0.25 ng/ml. 
      The intra- and inter-day coefficients of variation were below 3.03%. Sorafenib 
      recovery in spiked probes of peritoneal fluid was above 85%. Sorafenib 
      concentrations in 44 serum samples and 14 probes of peritoneal fluid have been 
      determined with a mean of 3,328 and 1,380 ng/ml, respectively (standard deviation 
      2,267 and 659 ng/ml). CONCLUSIONS: A sensitive and selective HPLC method for the 
      determination of sorafenib in human serum was developed and also verified for 
      peritoneal fluid. This method provides a useful tool for pharmacokinetic 
      investigations as well as for therapeutic drug monitoring of sorafenib.

TI  - Effect of glucuronidation on transport and tissue accumulation of tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors: consequences for the clinical management of sorafenib and 
      regorafenib.
PG  - 785-94
LID - 10.1517/17425255.2015.1030392 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are a multigenic family of 
      enzymes responsible for the glucuronidation reaction. Many therapeutic classes of 
      drugs used in solid tumors are UGT substrates, including cancer therapies. AREAS 
      COVERED: This article describes the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) undergoing 
      hepatic glucuronidation; its effect on transport and tissue accumulation and the 
      clinical consequences of this particular metabolism. A PubMed search concerning 
      the pharmacokinetics of the TKIs was performed. All are extensively metabolized 
      by CYP450. Two TKIs, sorafenib and regorafenib, also have a major UGT-mediated 
      metabolism and were therefore studied. EXPERT OPINION: The prescription of the 
      same dose of sorafenib and regorafenib for all patients may be inappropriate 
      since at each enzymatic step of this multistep metabolism inter-individual 
      fluctuations exist. Having a non-exclusive CYP-mediated route of metabolism may 
      reduce the risk of variability in drug exposure when CYP3A4 substrates are 
      concomitantly given. Several clinical consequences derive from this 
      pharmacokinetic particularity of sorafenib and regorafenib. Since no clear 
      difference distinguishes TKIs in efficacy in large randomized trials, the 
      differences for the clinical management of their toxicity is a critical aspect.

TI  - Sorafenib for Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Child-Pugh B Liver 
      Cirrhosis: Lessons Learned from a Terminated Study.
PG  - e1274-e1279
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0718 [doi]
AB  - LESSONS LEARNED: Recruitment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma 
      and Child-Pugh B for sorafenib treatment and additional pharmacokinetic studies 
      is challenging. Patients with Child-Pugh B liver cirrhosis have high rates of 
      cirrhosis-related adverse events. BACKGROUND: Few data are available on the 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) and Child-Pugh B liver cirrhosis. This study aimed to explore the 
      sorafenib PK and its relationship with efficacy and toxicity in these patients. 
      METHODS: Patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh B7-8 liver function were 
      prospectively recruited at a tertiary center. Adverse events (AEs), 
      progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were recorded. 
      Patients received a starting dose of 200 b.i.d. with toxicity-adjusted dose 
      escalation to a target dose of 400 mg b.i.d. with PK sampling at fixed time 
      points. RESULTS: Between May 2014 and March 2017, 12 patients were screened, of 
      whom 7 progressed to a terminal stage during the screening (n = 6) or shortly 
      after recruitment (n = 1). The five included patients had median PFS of 3.8 
      months (range, 1.7-10.8) and OS of 7.4 months (range, 1.7-25.8). Three patients 
      had severe AEs and one patient had a partial response with an OS of 25.8 months. 
      In 2017, the trial was aborted for lack of accrual. CONCLUSION: Because of low 
      accrual, no conclusion can be drawn on the sorafenib PK in patients with advanced 
      HCC and Child-Pugh B liver cirrhosis. The poor survival and frequent 
      cirrhosis-related AEs suggest limited benefit for most of these patients.

TI  - Health Benefits and Pharmacological Properties of Stigmasterol.
LID - 10.3390/antiox11101912 [doi]
LID - 1912
AB  - Stigmasterol is an unsaturated phytosterol belonging to the class of tetracyclic 
      triterpenes. It is one of the most common plant sterols, found in a variety of 
      natural sources, including vegetable fats or oils from many plants. Currently, 
      stigmasterol has been examined via in vitro and in vivo assays and molecular 
      docking for its various biological activities on different metabolic disorders. 
      The findings indicate potent pharmacological effects such as anticancer, 
      anti-osteoarthritis, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, immunomodulatory, 
      antiparasitic, antifungal, antibacterial, antioxidant, and neuroprotective 
      properties. Indeed, stigmasterol from plants and algae is a promising molecule in 
      the development of drugs for cancer therapy by triggering intracellular signaling 
      pathways in numerous cancers. It acts on the Akt/mTOR and JAK/STAT pathways in 
      ovarian and gastric cancers. In addition, stigmasterol markedly disrupted 
      angiogenesis in human cholangiocarcinoma by tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and 
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) signaling 
      down-regulation. The association of stigmasterol and sorafenib promoted caspase-3 
      activity and down-regulated levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 in breast 
      cancer. Antioxidant activities ensuring lipid peroxidation and DNA damage 
      lowering conferred to stigmasterol chemoprotective activities in skin cancer. 
      Reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation also contributes to the neuroprotective 
      effects of stigmasterol, as well as dopamine depletion and acetylcholinesterase 
      inhibition. The anti-inflammatory properties of phytosterols involve the 
      production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, the decrease in inflammatory mediator 
      release, and the inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and 
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Stigmasterol exerts anti-diabetic effects by reducing 
      fasting glucose, serum insulin levels, and oral glucose tolerance. Other findings 
      showed the antiparasitic activities of this molecule against certain strains of 
      parasites such as Trypanosoma congolense (in vivo) and on promastigotes and 
      amastigotes of the Leishmania major (in vitro). Some stigmasterol-rich plants 
      were able to inhibit Candida albicans, virusei, and tropicalis at low doses. 
      Accordingly, this review outlines key insights into the pharmacological abilities 
      of stigmasterol and the specific mechanisms of action underlying some of these 
      effects. Additionally, further investigation regarding pharmacodynamics, 
      pharmacokinetics, and toxicology is recommended.

TI  - Exogenous albumin inhibits sorafenib-induced cytotoxicity in human cancer cell 
      lines.
PG  - 29-34
AB  - Sorafenib is an orally administered multikinase inhibitor that exhibits 
      anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity. Sorafenib is also known to bind to 
      protein (>99.5%), suggesting protein binding may be involved in sorafenib 
      pharmacokinetic variability. Albumin is a major drug-binding protein. In this 
      study, we examined the effect of albumin on sorafenib-induced cytotoxicity using 
      two in vitro culture cell lines, human hepatoma Huh-7 cells and 
      androgen-independent prostate cancer PC-3 cells. The cells were cultured and 
      incubated, and cytotoxicity was assessed. Results were confirmed by western 
      blotting. The presence of exogenous albumin markedly blocked the 
      sorafenib-induced cytotoxicity in the two cell lines. Albumin concentration, the 
      change of pharmacological signal transduction as Raf-B, vascular endothelial 
      growth factor (VEGF), and phosphorylation of MEK1/2 or ERK1/2 were found to be 
      decreased by sorafenib. Co-incubation of warfarin, a representative coumarin 
      anticoagulant and potent binding activity, with albumin enhanced the cytotoxic 
      effects by sorafenib. These mechanisms depend on the high binding proper ties of 
      sorafenib and exogenous albumin. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of endo 
      genous albumin expression on sorafenib-induced cytotoxicity using the siRNA 
      knockdown system or transfected expression vector assay. However, the cytotoxic 
      effects by sorafenib showed little change either with the knockdown or 
      overexpression of albumin. Our results suggest that particular care should be 
      taken with albuminemia or the combined use of drugs with a high affinity for 
      albumin, such as warfarin, and sorafenib in the treatment of cancer patients. Our 
      findings may be useful to the cancer therapeutic strategy by sorafenib.

TI  - Cytochrome P450-Mediated Biotransformation of Sorafenib and Its N-Oxide 
      Metabolite: Implications for Cell Viability and Human Toxicity.
PG  - 92-102
LID - 10.1021/tx500373g [doi]
AB  - The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib (SRF) is approved for the treatment of renal 
      and hepatic carcinomas and is also undergoing evaluation in therapeutic 
      combinations with other anticancer agents. SRF is generally well tolerated but 
      produces severe toxicities in a significant proportion of patients by mechanisms 
      that are largely unknown. It has been shown that cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 has a 
      major role in SRF biotransformation to the pharmacologically active N-oxide 
      (SRF-Nox) and two other metabolites. In this study, we prepared the major 
      metabolites of SRF and evaluated their further biotransformation by CYPs in 
      relation to their capacity to produce cellular toxicity. CYP3A4 was also found to 
      be the principal enzyme that mediated the secondary oxidation of SRF metabolites. 
      However, the reduction of SRF-Nox to SRF was also found to be a significant 
      reaction mediated by several CYPs, especially CYPs 2B6 and 1A1. In human 
      liver-derived HepG2 cells, SRF effectively decreased ATP production to an extent 
      greater than that of its metabolites. SRF also markedly altered the cell cycle 
      distribution in HepG2 cells by decreasing the proportion in G0/G1 phase and 
      increasing that in S and G2/M phases. In comparison, SRF metabolites minimally 
      affected HepG2 cell cycle progression. These findings suggest that SRF, but not 
      its metabolites, prevents cells from entering the cell cycle and also inhibits 
      cycling cells from completing mitosis. Reduction of the major metabolite SRF-Nox 
      back to SRF may mediate decreased cellular viability and contribute to adverse 
      reactions in some individuals.

TI  - Cytochrome P450 3A5 polymorphism affects the metabolism of sorafenib and its 
      toxicity for hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro.
PG  - S646-S653
LID - 10.1177/09603271211052989 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP3A5) is a highly polymorphic gene and the 
      encoded protein variants differ in catalytic activity, leading to 
      inter-individual variation in metabolic ability. The aim of the current study was 
      to investigate the effects of seven allelic variants on the ability of CYP3A5 to 
      metabolize sorafenib in vitro and further explore the impacts of CYP3A5 
      polymorphism on the proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cell 
      line (HepG2) induced by sorafenib. METHODS: Wild-type and variant CYP3A5 enzymes 
      were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda insect cells using a baculovirus 
      dual-expression system, and protein expression was checked by western blot. The 
      enzymes were incubated with sorafenib at 37°C for 30 min, and formation of the 
      major metabolite sorafenib N-oxide was assayed using ultra-performance liquid 
      chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. Intrinsic clearance values 
      (V(max)/K(m)) were calculated for each enzyme. Additionally, recombinant HepG2 
      cells transfecting with CYP3A5 variants were used to investigate the effects of 
      sorafenib on the proliferation of HepG2 cells. RESULTS: Intrinsic clearance of 
      the six variants CYP3A5*2, CYP3A5*3A, CYP3A5*3C, CYP3A5*4, CYP3A5*5, and CYP3A5*7 
      was 26.41-71.04% of the wild-type (CYP3A5*1) value. In contrast, the clearance 
      value of the variant CYP3A5*6 was significantly higher (174.74%). Additionally, 
      the decreased ATP levels and cell viability and the increased cell apoptosis in 
      HepG2 cells transfected with CYP3A5*2, CYP3A5*3A, CYP3A5*3C, CYP3A5*4, CYP3A5*5, 
      and CYP3A5*7 were observed, whereas, the increased ATP levels and cell viability 
      and the reduced cell apoptosis in HepG2 cells transfected with CYP3A5*6 were also 
      investigated when compared to CYP3A5*1. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that 
      CYP3A5 polymorphism influences sorafenib metabolism and pharmacotherapeutic 
      effect in hepatic carcinomas. These data may help explain differential response 
      to drug therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma, and they support the need for 
      individualized treatment.

PG  - 453-61
AB  - Sorafenib is a small molecule inhibitor of several kinases involved in tumour 
      proliferation and tumour angiogenesis including Raf, VEGFR and platelet derived 
      growth factor receptor. In vivo Raf kinase inhibition has been observed in 
      pharmacodynamic studies. Sorafenib is one of several VEGF-targeting compounds 
      with recently demonstrated substantial anti-tumour effects in metastatic renal 
      cell carcinoma. Delay in time to disease progression has been demonstrated in 
      cytokine-refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma, and further investigation is 
      ongoing in a wide variety of tumour types. Sorafenib is well tolerated, with 
      common toxicities including rash, diarrhoea, hand-foot skin reaction, fatigue and 
      hypertension, when administered as the standard dose of 400 mg b.i.d.

TI  - Current Treatment Options for HCC: From Pharmacokinetics to Efficacy and Adverse 
      Events in Liver Cirrhosis.
PG  - 866-884
LID - 10.2174/1389200221999200918141239 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the world's most common 
      cancers. For over ten years, the only medical treatment for it has been the 
      multikinase inhibitor Sorafenib. Currently, however, other first or second-line 
      therapeutic options have also shown efficacy against HCC, such as multikinase 
      inhibitors (Regorafenib, Lenvatinib, and Cabozantinib), a monoclonal antibody 
      against the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (Ramucirumab), and 
      immune-checkpoint inhibitors (Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, Ipilimumab). AIM: The aim 
      of this paper is to review the metabolic pathways of drugs that have been tested 
      for the treatment of HCC and the potential influence of liver failure over those 
      pathways. METHODS: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s and European 
      Medicines Agency (EMA)'s datasheets, results from clinical trials and 
      observational studies have been reviewed. RESULTS: This review summarizes the 
      current knowledge regarding targets, metabolic pathways, drug interactions, and 
      adverse events of medical treatments for HCC in cirrhotic patients. CONCLUSION: 
      The new scenario of systemic HCC therapy includes more active drugs with 
      different metabolic pathways and different liver adverse events. Clinical and 
      pharmacological studies providing more data on the safety of these molecules are 
      urgently needed.

TI  - Combination targeted therapy with sorafenib and bevacizumab results in enhanced 
      toxicity and antitumor activity.
PG  - 3709-14
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2007.10.8332 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib inhibits Raf kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor 
      (VEGF) receptor. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeted against VEGF. We 
      hypothesized that the complementary inhibition of VEGF signaling would have 
      synergistic therapeutic effects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients had advanced 
      solid tumors, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1, 
      and good end-organ function. A phase I dose-escalation trial of sorafenib and 
      bevacizumab was initiated at below-recommended single-agent doses because of 
      possible overlapping toxicity: sorafenib 200 mg orally twice daily and 
      bevacizumab intravenously at 5 mg/kg (dose level [DL] 1) or 10 mg/kg (DL2) every 
      2 weeks. Additional patients were enrolled at the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). 
      RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were treated. DL1 was the MTD and administered in 
      cohort 2 (N = 27). Dose-limiting toxicity in DL2 was grade 3 proteinuria and 
      thrombocytopenia. Adverse events included hypertension, hand-foot syndrome, 
      diarrhea, transaminitis, and fatigue. Partial responses (PRs) were seen in six 
      (43%) of 13 patients with ovarian cancer (response duration range, 4 to 22+ 
      months) and one of three patients with renal cell cancer (response duration, 14 
      months). PR or disease stabilization >or= 4 months (median, 6 months; range, 4 to 
      22+ months) was seen in 22 (59%) of 37 assessable patients. The majority (74%) 
      required sorafenib dose reduction to 200 mg/d at a median of four cycles (range, 
      one to 12 cycles). CONCLUSION: Combination therapy with sorafenib and bevacizumab 
      has promising clinical activity, especially in patients with ovarian cancer. The 
      rapidity and frequency of sorafenib dose reductions indicates that sorafenib at 
      200 mg twice daily with bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks may not be tolerable 
      long term, and alternate sorafenib dosing schedules should be explored.

TI  - Codelivery of sorafenib and curcumin by directed self-assembled nanoparticles 
      enhances therapeutic effect on hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 922-31
LID - 10.1021/mp500755j [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common causes of cancer-related 
      mortality worldwide. Herein, we first reported the codelivery of sorafenib and 
      curcumin by directed self-assembled nanoparticles (SCN) to enhance the 
      therapeutic effect on HCC. SCN was formed by employing the hydrophobic 
      interactions among the lipophilic structure in sorafenib, curcumin, and similar 
      hydrophobic segments of polyethylene glycol derivative of vitamin E succinate 
      (PEG-VES), which comprised uniform spherical particles with particle size of 
      84.97 ± 6.03 nm. SCN presented superior effects over sorafenib, curcumin, and 
      their physical mixture (Sora + Cur) on enhancing in vitro cytotoxicity and cell 
      apoptosis in BEL-7402 cells and Hep G2 cells, and antiangiogenesis activities in 
      tube formation and microvessel formation from aortic rings. Moreover, the tissue 
      concentration of sorafenib and curcumin in gastrointestinal tract and major 
      organs were significantly improved after their coassembly into SCN. In 
      particular, in BEL-7402 cells induced tumor xenograft, SCN treatment displayed 
      the obviously enhanced inhibitory effect on tumor progression over free drug 
      monotherapy or their physical mixture, with significantly increased 
      antiproliferation and antiangiogenesis capability. Thereby, the codelivered 
      nanoassemblies of sorafenib and curcumin provided a promising strategy to enhance 
      the combinational therapy of HCC.

TI  - Oral sorafenib-loaded microemulsion for breast cancer: evidences from the 
      in-vitro evaluations and pharmacokinetic studies.
PG  - 13746
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17333-6 [doi]
LID - 13746
AB  - Sorafenib tosylate (SFB) is a multikinase inhibitor that inhibits tumour growth 
      and proliferation for the management of breast cancer but is also associated with 
      issues like toxicity and drug resistance. Also, being a biopharmaceutical class 
      II (BCS II) drug, its oral bioavailability is the other challenge. Henceforth, 
      this report intended to encapsulate SFB into a biocompatible carrier with 
      biodegradable components, i.e., phospholipid. The microemulsion of the SFB was 
      prepared and characterized for the surface charge, morphology, micromeritics and 
      drug release studies. The cell viability assay was performed on 4T1 cell lines 
      and inferred that the IC(50) value of sorafenib-loaded microemulsion (SFB-loaded 
      ME) was enhanced compared to the naïve SFB at the concentrations of about 
      0.75 µM. More drug was available for the pharmacological response, as the protein 
      binding was notably decreased, and the drug from the developed carriers was 
      released in a controlled manner. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic studies 
      established that the developed nanocarrier was suitable for the oral 
      administration of a drug by substantially enhancing the bioavailability of the 
      drug to that of the free SFB. The results bring forth the preliminary evidence 
      for the future scope of SFB as a successful therapeutic entity in its nano-form 
      for effective and safer cancer chemotherapy via the oral route.

TI  - Interaction of the multikinase inhibitors sorafenib and sunitinib with solute 
      carriers and ATP-binding cassette transporters.
PG  - 6062-9
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0048 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare side-by-side the uptake of sorafenib and sunitinib in vitro 
      by human uptake solute carriers of the SLC22A and SLCO families, the transport by 
      and inhibition of efflux ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, and the role of 
      ABCB1 in the plasma pharmacokinetics and brain penetration of these agents. 
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Uptake of [(3)H]sorafenib or [(3)H]sunitinib was assessed in 
      Xenopus laevis oocytes or mammalian cells transfected with cDNAs coding for human 
      OATP1A2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OAT2, OAT3, OCTN1, or OCTN2. Efflux and 
      inhibition experiments were conducted in cells transfected with human ABCB1, 
      ABCG2, ABCC2, or ABCC4. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies were done in knockout 
      mice lacking Abcb1-type transporters. RESULTS: Intracellular uptake was not 
      appreciably affected by any of the studied solute carriers and was minute 
      relative to the respective prototypical substrates. Sorafenib and sunitinib 
      showed concentration-dependent (1 and 10 micromol/L), low to moderate affinity 
      for ABCB1 but were not affected by the other ABC transporters. Both agents 
      inhibited all tested ABC transporters. The absence of Abcb1 had no affect on 
      plasma pharmacokinetics, but brain penetration was moderately increased by 1.9- 
      and 2.9-fold for sorafenib and sunitinib, respectively, in knockout animals 
      versus controls. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, sorafenib 
      and sunitinib do not appear to rely on active transport to enter the cell nor are 
      they high-affinity substrates for ABC efflux transporters. Based on these 
      characteristics, these two drugs may be less susceptible to transporter-mediated 
      alterations in systemic exposure and transporter-related resistance mechanisms.

TI  - DYRK1A suppression attenuates HIF‑1α accumulation and enhances the anti‑liver 
      cancer effects of regorafenib and sorafenib under hypoxic conditions.
LID - 45 [pii]
LID - 10.3892/ijo.2022.5335 [doi]
AB  - Hypoxia promotes drug resistance and induces the expression of hypoxia inducible 
      factor (HIF)‑1α in liver cancer cells. However, to date, no selective HIF‑1α 
      inhibitor has been clinically approved. The aim of this study is to investigate a 
      drug‑targetable molecule that can regulate HIF‑1α under hypoxia. The present 
      study demonstrated that hyperactivation of dual‑specificity 
      tyrosine‑phosphorylation‑regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A)/HIF‑1α signaling was 
      associated with an increased risk of liver cancer. In addition, DYRK1A knockdown 
      using small interfering RNA transfection or treatment with harmine, a natural 
      alkaloid, significantly reduced the protein expression levels of HIF‑1α in liver 
      cancer cells under hypoxic conditions in vitro. Conversely, DYRK1A 
      overexpression‑vector transfection in liver cancer cell lines notably induced 
      HIF‑1α expression under the same conditions. Furthermore, DYRK1A was shown to 
      interact and activate STAT3 under hypoxia to regulate HIF‑1α expression. These 
      findings indicated that DYRK1A may be a potential upstream activator of HIF‑1α 
      and positively regulate HIF‑1α via the STAT3 signaling pathway in liver cancer 
      cells. Additionally, treatment with harmine attenuated the proliferative ability 
      of liver cancer cells under hypoxic conditions using sulforhodamine B and colony 
      formation assay. Furthermore, DYRK1A knockdown could significantly enhance the 
      anti‑liver cancer effects of regorafenib and sorafenib under hypoxia. 
      Co‑treatment with harmine and either regorafenib or sorafenib also promoted cell 
      death via the STAT3/HIF‑1α/AKT signaling pathway under hypoxia using PI staining 
      and western blotting. Overall, the results from the present study suggested that 
      DYRK1A/HIF‑1α signaling may be considered a novel pathway involved in 
      chemoresistance, thus providing a potentially effective therapeutic regimen for 
      treating liver cancer.

AB  - Aim: To predict the impact of the different CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes on 
      warfarin-sorafenib interactions in whites and Asians. Materials & methods: The 
      influences of the CYP2C9*1/*3 and VKORC1 -1639 A/A genotypes on increases in 
      anticoagulation responses (international normalized ratio [INR]) in the presence 
      of sorafenib were predicted using the population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
      (PK/PD) model in whites and Asians. Results: INRs were predicted to be 
      2.0-2.1- versus 1.8-1.9-times higher in the presence of sorafenib in the CYP2C9 
      (*1/*1 vs *1/*3) groups than those for warfarin alone in both whites and Asians. 
      INRs were also predicted to be 2.1-2.2- versus 1.9-2.1-times higher in the VKORC1 
      (GG or GA vs AA) groups. Conclusion: Warfarin-sorafenib interactions might be 
      similar irrespective of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes or ethnicity.

TI  - Phase I pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of cetuximab, irinotecan and

AB  - Background This phase Ib study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated 
      doses (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of irinotecan and cetuximab with 
      sorafenib. Secondary objectives included characterizing the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics and evaluating preliminary antitumor activity in patients with 
      advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods Patients with metastatic, pretreated 
      CRC were treated at five dose levels. Results Eighteen patients were recruited 
      with median age 56.5 years. In the first five patients treated, 2 irinotecan 
      related DLTs were observed. With reduced dose intensity irinotecan, there were no 
      further DLTs. The most common toxicities were diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, fatigue, 
      anorexia and rash. DLTs included neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Two patients 
      had partial responses (one with a KRAS mutation) and 8 had stable disease 
      (8-36 weeks). The median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival 
      (OS) were 2.5 and 4.7 months respectively. Pharmacokinetic analyses suggest 
      sorafenib and metabolite exposure correlate with OS and DLTs. Conclusions The 
      recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is irinotecan 100 mg/m(2) i.v. days 1, 8; 
      cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) i.v. days 1 and 250 mg/m(2) i.v. weekly; and sorafenib 
      400 mg orally twice daily in advanced, pretreated CRC. The combination resulted 
      in a modest response rate.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy 
      worldwide. Unresectable disease patients have median survival of few months. 
      There is a substantial need for novel treatments for patients with advanced HCC. 
      AIM: To provide an update review of mechanism of hepatocarcinigenesis and 
      systemic therapies for HCC and the relevant role of Sorafenib in patients with 
      advanced disease. METHODS: A Medline search was performed to identify pertinent 
      original research and review articles. Selected references in these articles were 
      also evaluated. RESULTS: Systemic chemotherapy for HCC has been quite 
      ineffective. Preclinical studies demonstrated that Raf/MAPK-ERK kinase 
      (MEK)/Extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) pathway has a role in HCC. HCC 
      tumours are highly vascularized and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
      augments HCC development and metastasis. Sorafenib blocks tumour cell 
      proliferation by targeting Raf/MEK/ERK signalling and exerts an antiangiogenic 
      effect by targeting VEGF receptors-2/3 and platelet derived growth factor 
      receptor beta tyrosine kinases. CONCLUSIONS: Currently available therapies are 
      not effective for patients with advanced HCC. Sorafenib has demonstrated for the 
      first time to prolong survival in patients with advanced HCC, and it is the new 
      reference standard for systemic treatment in these patients.

TI  - Sorafenib in advanced melanoma: a critical role for pharmacokinetics?
PG  - 455-61
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2012.287 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inter-patient pharmacokinetic variability can lead to suboptimal drug 
      exposure, and therefore might impact the efficacy of sorafenib. This study 
      reports long-term pharmacokinetic monitoring of patients treated with sorafenib 
      and a retrospective pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic analysis in melanoma 
      patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Heavily pretreated patients with stage IV 
      melanoma were started on sorafenib 400 mg twice daily (bid). In the absence of 
      limiting toxicity, dose escalation of 200 mg bid levels was done every 2 weeks. 
      Plasma sorafenib measurement was performed at each visit, allowing a 
      retrospective pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic analysis for safety and efficacy. 
      RESULTS: In all, 19 of 30 patients underwent dose escalation over 400 mg bid, and 
      28 were evaluable for response. The overall disease control rate was 61% (95% 
      confidence interval (CI): 42.6-78.8), including three confirmed responses (12%). 
      Disease control rate and progression-free survival (PFS) were improved in 
      patients with high vs low exposure (80% vs 32%, P=0.02, and 5.25 vs 2.5 months, 
      P=0.005, hazard ratio (HR)=0.28 (95% CI: 0.11-0.73)). In contrast, drug dosing 
      had no effect on PFS. In multivariate analysis, drug exposure was the only factor 
      associated with PFS (HR=0.36 (95% CI: 0.13-0.99)). Diarrhoea and anorexia were 
      correlated with drug dosing, while hypertension and hand-foot skin reaction were 
      correlated with drug exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Although sorafenib had modest 
      efficacy in melanoma, these results suggest a correlation between exposure and 
      efficacy of sorafenib. Therefore, dose optimisation in patients with low exposure 
      at standard doses should be evaluated in validated indications.

      cyclophosphamide and sorafenib (LCS) is well tolerated and shows activity in 
      primary breast cancer (BC). METHODS: Thirteen oestrogen receptor-positive, 
      postmenopausal, T2-4, N0-1 BC patients received the LCS combination for 6 months. 
      In these patients we examined the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib and 
      cyclophosphamide, toxicity of the regimen, the clinical response to therapy and 
      changes in the levels of biologically relevant biomarkers. RESULTS: Adequate 
      plasma concentrations of sorafenib were achieved in patients when it was dosed in 
      combination with L+C. The mean plasma concentrations of C were consistently lower 
      following administration of LCS, compared with administration of L+C only. The 
      most common drug-related grade 3/4 adverse events were skin rash (69.3%), 
      hand-foot skin reaction (69.3%) and diarrhoea (46.1%). According to RECIST 
      Criteria, a clinical complete response was observed in 6 of 13 patients. A 
      significant reduction in tumour size, evaluated with MRI, was also observed 
      between baseline and 14 days of treatment in all 13 patients (P=0.005). A 
      significant reduction in SUV uptake, measured by (18)FDG-PET/CT, was observed in 
      all patients between baseline and 30 days of treatment (P=0.015) and between 
      baseline and definitive surgery (P=0.0002). Using modified CT Criteria, a 
      response was demonstrated in 8 out of 10 evaluable patients at 30 days and in 11 
      out of 13 evaluable patients at the definitive surgery. A significant reduction 
      in Ki67 expression was observed in all patients at day 14 compared with baseline 
      (P<0.00001) and in 9 out of 13 patients at the definitive surgery compared with 
      baseline (P<0.03). There was also a significant suppression of CD31 and VEGF-A 
      expression in response to treatment (P=0.01 and P=0.007, respectively). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The LCS combination is feasible and tolerable. The tumour response 
      and target biomarker modulation indicate that the combination is clinically and 
      biologically active.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors 
      worldwide. In this study, sorafenib-loaded lipid-based nanosuspensions 
      (sorafenib-LNS) were first developed as an intravenous injectable formulation to 
      increase the efficacy of sorafenib against HCC. LNS were used as nanocarriers for 
      sorafenib owing to their desired features in increasing the solubility and 
      dissolution velocity, improving the bioavailability of sorafenib. Sorafenib-LNS 
      were prepared by nanoprecipitation and consisted of spherical particles with a 
      uniform size distribution (164.5 nm, polydispersity index =0.202) and negative 
      zeta potential (-11.0 mV). The drug loading (DL) was 10.55%±0.16%. Sorafenib-LNS 
      showed higher in vitro cytotoxicity than sorafenib against HepG2 cells (P<0.05) 
      and Bel-7402 cells (P<0.05). The in vivo biodistribution, biocompatibility, and 
      antitumor efficacy of sorafenib-LNS were evaluated in H22-bearing liver cancer 
      xenograft murine model. The results showed that sorafenib-LNS (9 mg/kg) exhibited 
      significantly higher antitumor efficacy by reducing the tumor volume compared 
      with the sorafenib oral group (18 mg/kg, P<0.05) and sorafenib injection group (9 
      mg/kg, P<0.05). Furthermore, the results of the in vivo biodistribution 
      experiments demonstrated that sorafenib-LNS injected into H22 tumor-bearing mice 
      exhibited increased accumulation in the tumor tissue, which was confirmed by in 
      vivo imaging. In the current experimental conditions, sorafenib-LNS did not show 
      significant toxicity both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that 
      sorafenib-LNS are a promising nanomedicine for treating HCC.

AB  - AIM: The safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of sorafenib plus docetaxel in 
      patients with advanced refractory cancer were investigated in a phase I, 
      dose-escalation trial. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients in four cohorts received 
      docetaxel on day 1 (cohorts 1 and 4: 75 mg/m2; cohorts 2 and 3: 100 mg/m2) plus 
      sorafenib on days 2-19 (cohorts 1 and 2: 200 mg twice-daily (bid); cohorts 3 and 
      4: 400 mg bid) in 21-day cycles. RESULTS: Most common adverse events (AEs) (grade 
      3-5) included neutropenia (89%), leucopaenia (81%), hand-foot skin reaction (30%) 
      and fatigue (30%). The most common drug-related AEs leading to dose 
      reduction/interruption or permanent discontinuation were dermatologic (41%), 
      gastrointestinal (26%) and constitutional (22%). Coadministration of sorafenib 
      altered the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. On average, docetaxel area under the 
      concentration-time curve (AUC)(0-24) increased by 5% (cohort 1), 54% (cohort 2), 
      36% (Cohort 3) and 80% (cohort 4) with docetaxel plus sorafenib, while C(max) 
      increased by 16-32%, independent of sorafenib/docetaxel doses. Three of 25 
      evaluable patients (11%) had partial responses; 14 (52%) had stable disease. 
      CONCLUSION: Dose-limiting dermatologic AEs were more common than expected for 
      either therapy alone. A starting dose of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 plus sorafenib 400mg 
      bid (with dose reductions for dermatological toxicities) is proposed for phase 
      II.

TI  - Monitoring Serum Levels of Sorafenib and Its N-Oxide Is Essential for Long-Term 
      Sorafenib Treatment of Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 173-82
LID - 10.1620/tjem.237.173 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor, is the final therapy prior to 
      palliative care for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, due to its 
      adverse effects, 20% of patients must discontinue sorafenib within 1 month after 
      first administration. To identify ways to predict the adverse effects and 
      administer the drug for longer periods, we explored the relationship between the 
      duration of sorafenib treatment and the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib and its 
      major metabolite, sorafenib N-oxide. Twenty-five subjects enrolled in the study 
      were divided into two groups: patients with dosage reduced or withdrawn due to 
      adverse effects (n = 8), and patients with dosage maintained for 1 month after 
      initial administration (n = 17). We evaluated early sorafenib accumulation as the 
      area under the curve of sorafenib and sorafenib N-oxide concentrations during 
      days 1-7 (AUC(sorafenib) and AUC(N-oxide), respectively). Inter-group comparison 
      revealed that AUC(N-oxide) and AUC ratio (AUC(N-oxide)/AUC(sorafenib)) were 
      significantly higher in the dosage reduction/withdrawal group (P = 0.031 and P = 
      0.0022, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that 
      AUC(N-oxide) and AUC ratio were reliable predictors of adverse effects. When 
      patients were classified by cut-off points (AUC(N-oxide:) 2.0 μg ∙ day/mL, AUC 
      ratio: 0.13), progression-free survival was significantly longer in patients with 
      AUC(N-oxide) ≤ 2.0 μg ∙ day/mL (P = 0.0048, log-rank test). In conclusion, we 
      recommend to simultaneously monitor serum levels of sorafenib and its N-oxide 
      during the early stage after the first administration, which enables us to 
      provide safe and long-term therapy for each HCC patient with sorafenib.

TI  - Variability of sorafenib toxicity and exposure over time: a 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis.
PG  - 1204-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib displays major interpatient pharmacokinetic variability. It 
      is unknown whether the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib influence its toxicity. 
      METHODS: We analyzed the severity and kinetics of sorafenib-induced toxicities in 
      unselected consecutive patients with cancer, as well as their relationship with 
      biological, clinical, and pharmacokinetic parameters. Toxicity was recorded 
      bimonthly. Sorafenib plasma concentrations were assessed by liquid 
      chromatography. RESULTS: For 83 patients (median age, 62 years; range, 21-84 
      years), median sorafenib 12-hour area under the curve (AUC(0-12)) was 52.8 mg · 
      h/L (range: 11.8-199.6). A total of 51 patients (61%) experienced grade 3-4 
      toxicities, including hand-foot skin reactions (23%), asthenia (18%), and 
      diarrhea (11%). Sorafenib AUC(0-12) preceding grade 3-4 toxicities was 
      significantly higher than that observed in the remaining population (61.9 mg · 
      h/L vs. 53 mg · h/L). In 25 patients treated with fixed doses of sorafenib for 
      the first 4 months, median dose-normalized AUC(0-12) on day 120 was significantly 
      lower than on day 15 (63 vs. 102 mg · h/L). The incidence of hypertension and 
      hand-foot skin reactions significantly decreased over time. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib 
      AUC(0-12) decreases over time, similarly to the incidence of hypertension and 
      hand-foot skin reactions. Monitoring of sorafenib plasma concentrations may help 
      to prevent acute severe toxicities and detect patients with suboptimal exposure 
      at disease progression.

TI  - Preclinical evaluation of sorafenib-eluting stent for suppression of human 
      cholangiocarcinoma cells.
PG  - 1697-711
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S43508 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cholangiocarcinoma is a malignant tumor arising from the epithelium 
      of the bile ducts. In this study, we prepared sorafenib-loaded biliary stents for 
      potential application as drug-delivery systems for localized treatment of 
      extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. METHODS: A sorafenib-coated metal stent was 
      prepared using an electrospray system with the aid of poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), 
      and then its anticancer activity was investigated using human cholangiocellular 
      carcinoma (HuCC)-T1 cells in vitro and a mouse tumor xenograft model in vivo. 
      Anticancer activity of sorafenib against HuCC-T1 cells was evaluated by the 
      proliferation test, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, cancer cell 
      invasion, and angiogenesis assay in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: The drug-release 
      study showed that the increased drug content on the PCL film induced a faster 
      drug-release rate. The growth of cancer cells on the sorafenib-loaded PCL film 
      surfaces decreased in a dose-dependent manner. MMP-2 expression of HuCC-T1 cells 
      gradually decreased according to sorafenib concentration. Furthermore, cancer 
      cell invasion and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells 
      significantly decreased at sorafenib concentrations higher than 10 mM. In the 
      mouse tumor xenograft model with HuCC-T1 cells, sorafenib-eluting PCL films 
      significantly inhibited the growth of tumor mass and induced apoptosis of tumor 
      cells. Various molecular signals, such as B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2, 
      Bcl-2-associated death promoter, Bcl-x, caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, Fas, signal 
      transducer and activator of transcription 5, extracellular signal-regulated 
      kinases, MMP-9 and pan-janus kinase/stress-activated protein kinase 1, indicated 
      that apoptosis, inhibition of growth and invasion was cleared on 
      sorafenib-eluting PCL films. CONCLUSION: These sorafenib-loaded PCL films are 
      effective in inhibiting angiogenesis, proliferation and invasion of cancer cells. 
      We suggest that sorafenib-loaded PCL film is a promising candidate for the local 
      treatment of cholangiocarcinoma.

TI  - Effects of voriconazole and fluconazole on the pharmacokinetics of almonertinib 
      in rats by UPLC-MS/MS.
PG  - e5525
LID - 10.1002/bmc.5525 [doi]
AB  - Almonertinib was included in the first-line treatment of non-small cell lung 
      cancer with EGFR T790M mutations by the Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology in 
      2021. Considering that immunocompromised lung cancer patients are prone to 
      opportunistic fungal infections, and most triazole antifungal drugs are moderate 
      or strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, this study was conducted to develop and validate 
      an accurate and rapid ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass 
      spectrometry method for quantifying almonertinib in plasma and for investigating 
      the pharmacokinetic changes of almonertinib caused by voriconazole and 
      fluconazole in rats. After liquid-liquid extraction with tert-butyl methyl ether, 
      an XSelect HSS T3 column (2.1 × 100 mm, 2.5 μm, Waters) was used for the 
      chromatographic separation of almonertinib and sorafenib-D(3) (internal 
      standard). The analytes were detected using an AB Sciex Triple Quad 5,500 mass 
      spectrometer in the positive ionization mode. The method exhibited great 
      linearity (0.5-200 ng/ml, r > 0.997) and stability under the established 
      experimental conditions. All validation experiments were in accordance with the 
      guidelines, and the results were all within the acceptable limits. This method 
      was successfully applied to the researches of pharmacokinetics and drug 
      interactions for almonertinib in rats. Voriconazole and fluconazole significantly 
      altered the pharmacokinetic profiles of almonertinib and increased the systemic 
      exposure of almonertinib in rats to different degrees, but further human trials 
      should be conducted to validate the results.

AB  - To evaluate the effect and mechanism of radiotherapy (RT)-sorafenib 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) in different regimens with conventional or high dose 
      irradiation. Between February 2012 and December 2018, 43 patients with portal 
      vein tumor thrombosis treated with sorafenib plus conventional RT (58%) or 
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT, 42%) were retrospectively reviewed. In 
      vivo and in vitro studies of concurrent and sequential RT with sorafenib were 
      designed. SBRT resulted in a 3-fold increase in complete recanalization compared 
      to conventional RT group (28% vs. 8%, p = 0.014). Compared to the control group, 
      the area under the concentration vs. time curve (AUC) of sorafenib was increased 
      in the concurrent RT(2Gy) and RT(9Gy) groups and the sequential RT(9Gy) group by 
      132% (p = 0.046), 163% (p = 0.038) and 102% (p = 0.018), respectively; and was 
      decreased by 59% in the sequential RT(2Gy) group (p = 0.036). Sequential RT(2Gy) 
      and RT(9Gy) increased CYP3A4 activity by 82% (p = 0.028) and 203% (p = 0.0004), 
      respectively, compared to that with the corresponding concurrent regimen. SBRT 
      produced better recanalization than conventional RT with sorafenib. The AUC of 
      sorafenib was modulated by RT. P-gp expression was not influenced by RT. The 
      sequential RT regimen increased CYP3A4 activity that may increase the 
      RT-sorafenib synergy effect and overall sorafenib activity. The biodistribution 
      of sorafenib was modulated by local RT with the different regimens.

TI  - A quantitative HPLC-UV method for determination of serum sorafenib and sorafenib 
      N-oxide and its application in hepatocarcinoma patients.
PG  - 103-12
AB  - Sorafenib, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor, has been approved for treatment of 
      advanced renal-cell and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, 20% of HCC 
      patients taking sorafenib are forced to withdraw due to adverse effects within 
      one month after administration. Orally administered sorafenib is oxidatively 
      metabolized, predominantly by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), in small-intestinal 
      mucosa or liver. We aimed to characterize the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of 
      sorafenib in HCC patients and explore the contribution of the major metabolite 
      sorafenib N-oxide to adverse effects and therapeutic efficacy. We have therefore 
      developed a method for quantitative determination of sorafenib and its N-oxide in 
      the present study. To optimize the preanalytical procedure, we initially 
      ascertained the solubility of the analytes. Because they are lipophilic, solvents 
      containing more than 40% acetonitrile were required for efficient recovery. The 
      pretreatment procedure that we ultimately developed consists of acetonitrile 
      precipitation, followed by extraction using octadecyl silyl-silica gel to 
      eliminate water-soluble and hydrophilic components of serum. Application of this 
      procedure before HPLC enabled accurate and reproducible quantitation of analytes 
      in a linear range from 0.03 to 30 μg/mL. After characterizing the peaks in the 
      HPLC-ultraviolet chromatogram obtained from a medicated patient by LC-tandem mass 
      spectrometry, we applied this method to HCC patients taking sorafenib, showing 
      large inter-individual differences in the pharmacokinetic profile. In conclusion, 
      our assay system should be useful for follow-up of patients taking sorafenib and 
      for exploring the association between the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib and its 
      N-oxide and the adverse effects or therapeutic efficacy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: With growing knowledge of the molecular pathway of carcinogenesis, 
      targeted therapies have become the 'blue ocean' of cancer treatment. sorafenib is 
      an oral multikinase inhibitor that targets Raf/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) 
      kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (Raf/MEK/ERK) and several 
      tyrosine kinases (VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, PDGFR-β) that has shown efficacy in 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). AREAS COVERED: An updated summary of the 
      preclinical and clinical experience with sorafenib in HCC is presented in this 
      paper. Data are based on abstracts from international conferences and journal 
      articles found in a PubMed search of literature published up to December 2011. 
      EXPERT OPINION: Based on favorable data from preclinical and clinical trials, 
      sorafenib has been approved as a standard therapy in advanced HCC. However, 
      further efforts to understand the additional roles of sorafenib in the treatment 
      of HCC are still necessary. Data for sorafenib will guide the development of new 
      drugs for the treatment of HCC.

      accumulation.
PG  - 319-26

AB  - Sorafenib is a second-generation, orally active multikinase inhibitor that is 
      approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and 
      patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. We studied active transport 
      of sorafenib in MDCK-II cells expressing human P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) or 
      ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein) or murine Abcg2. Sorafenib was 
      moderately transported by P-gp and more efficiently by ABCG2 and Abcg2. Because 
      sorafenib is taken orally, we orally administered sorafenib to wild-type, 
      Abcb1a/1b(-/-), Abcg2(-/-), and Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2(-/-) mice, completely lacking 
      functional Abcb1a/1b, Abcg2, or both, respectively, and we studied plasma 
      pharmacokinetics and brain accumulation. The systemic exposure on oral 
      administration was not different among all strains. However, brain accumulation 
      was 4.3-fold increased in Abcg2(-/-) mice and 9.3-fold increased in 
      Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2(-/-) mice. Moreover, when wild-type mice were treated with 
      sorafenib in combination with the dual P-gp and ABCG2 inhibitor elacridar, brain 
      accumulation was similar to that observed for Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2(-/-) mice. These 
      results show that the brain accumulation of sorafenib is primarily restricted by 
      ABCG2. This contrasts with previous studies using shared ABCG2 and P-gp 
      substrates, which all suggested that P-gp dominates at the blood-brain barrier, 
      and that an effect of ABCG2 is only evident when both transporters are absent. 
      Interestingly, for sorafenib, it is the other way around, that is, ABCG2, and not 
      P-gp, plays the dominant role in restricting its brain accumulation. Clinically, 
      our findings may be relevant for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma patients 
      with central nervous system relapses, as a dual ABCG2 and P-gp inhibitor might 
      improve the central nervous system entry and thereby the therapeutic efficacy of 
      sorafenib.

TI  - Dose-Dependent Sorafenib-Induced Immunosuppression Is Associated with Aberrant 
      NFAT Activation and Expression of PD-1 in T Cells.
LID - 10.3390/cancers11050681 [doi]
LID - 681
AB  - The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is the only standard first-line therapy for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we report the dose-dependent effects of 
      sorafenib on the immune response, which is related to nuclear factor of activated 
      T cells 1 (NFAT1) activity. In vitro and in vivo experiments were performed with 
      low and high doses of sorafenib using human T cells and spontaneous developed 
      woodchuck HCC models. In vitro studies demonstrated that following exposure to a 
      high dose of sorafenib the baseline activity of NFAT1 in T cells was 
      significantly increased. In a parallel event, high dose sorafenib resulted in a 
      significant decrease in T cell proliferation and increased the proportion of PD-1 
      expressing CD8+ T cells with NFAT1 activation. In the in vivo model, smaller 
      tumors were detected in the low-dose sorafenib treated group compared to the 
      placebo and high-dose treated groups. The low-dose sorafenib group showed a 
      significant tumor growth delay with significantly more CD3+ cells in tumor. This 
      study demonstrates that sorafenib has immunomodulatory effects in a dose- and 
      time-dependent manner. Higher dose of sorafenib treatment was associated with 
      immunosuppressive action. This observed effect of sorafenib should be taken into 
      consideration in the selection of optimum starting dose for future trials.

TI  - Synergistic interactions between sorafenib and everolimus in pancreatic cancer 
      xenografts in mice.
PG  - 1231-40
LID - 10.1007/s00280-013-2117-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Molecular targeting of cellular signaling pathways is a promising 
      approach in cancer therapy, but often fails to achieve sustained benefit because 
      of the activation of collateral cancer cell survival and proliferation pathways. 
      We tested the hypothesis that a combination of targeted agents that inhibit 
      compensatory pathways would be more effective than single agents in controlling 
      pancreatic cancer cell growth. We investigated whether everolimus, an mTOR 
      inhibitor, and sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, would together inhibit growth 
      of low-passage, patient-derived pancreatic cancer xenografts in mice more 
      efficaciously than either agent alone. METHODS: Tumor volume progression was 
      measured following treatment with both drugs as single agents, in combination, 
      and at multiple doses. Pharmacokinetics in tumors and other tissues was also 
      assessed. Pharmacodynamic interactions were evaluated quantitatively. RESULTS: A 
      5-week regimen of daily oral doses of 10 mg/kg sorafenib and 0.5 mg/kg 
      everolimus, alone and in combination, did not achieve significant tumor growth 
      inhibition. Higher doses (20 mg/kg of sorafenib and 1 mg/kg of everolimus) 
      inhibited tumor growth significantly when given alone and caused complete 
      inhibition of growth when given in combination. Tumor volume progression was 
      described by a linear growth model, and drug effects were described by Hill-type 
      inhibition. Using population modeling approaches, dual-interaction parameter 
      estimates indicated a highly synergistic pharmacodynamic interaction between the 
      two drugs. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that combinations of mTOR and 
      multi-kinase inhibitors may offer greater efficacy in pancreatic cancer than 
      either drug alone. Drug effects upon tumor stromal elements may contribute to the 
      enhanced anti-tumor efficacy.

TI  - Drug safety evaluation of sorafenib for treatment of solid tumors: consequences 
      for the risk assessment and management of cancer patients.
PG  - 663-73

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sorafenib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Considerable 
      clinical experience has been accumulated since its first Phase III clinical trial 
      in metastatic renal cancer patients in 2007. The management of its early acute 
      toxicity in fit patients is well known. The management of prolonged treatment 
      becomes the new challenge. AREAS COVERED: Using sorafenib as a key word for 
      PubMed search, we review preclinical and clinical data and discuss the 
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sorafenib, its acute and cumulative 
      toxicities and their consequences for patient management. EXPERT OPINION: The 
      systematic multi-disciplinary risk assessment of cancer patients prior to TKI 
      initiation reduces the risks of acute and late toxicity, especially drug-drug 
      interactions and arterial risks. Sarcopenia is now identified as a major risk of 
      severe toxicity. The very diverse clinical pictures of cumulative toxicity must 
      be known. The monitoring of sorafenib systemic exposure is helpful especially in 
      elderly patients. Moreover, at disease progression, it allows distinguishing 
      between underexposure to sorafenib and truly acquired resistance to the drug. The 
      optimal use of sorafenib should allow improving the reported results of 
      flat-dose. Finally, most of this knowledge could be used for the development and 
      optimal use of the other TKIs.

TI  - Polymorphisms to predict outcome to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib, 
      erlotinib, sorafenib and sunitinib.
PG  - 1649-59
AB  - Conventional chemotherapeutic regimens have limited impact against most solid 
      tumors and deal with significant toxicity. During the last years novel anticancer 
      treatments targeting specific molecules or genes involved in cancer development 
      are being developed to improve outcome and reduce side-effects. In particular 
      several tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs, gefitinib, erlotinib, sorafenib and 
      sunitinib) have been approved for the treatment of different solid tumors. Their 
      clinical activity has been related to different clinical and biological 
      parameters, such as the EGFR-activating mutations for gefitinib and erlotinib. 
      However, not all clinical outcomes, including tolerability, are explained, and 
      the identification/ validation of novel biomarkers is a viable area of research. 
      Germline polymorphisms can be easily assessed in blood samples, and polymorphisms 
      in EGFR, AKT1 and ABCG2 have been correlated with outcome and toxicity in lung 
      cancer patients given EGFR-TKIs therapies. However, there are several 
      controversial findings, influenced by differences in study design/analysis, while 
      the prognostic/predictive role of these polymorphisms still needs to be evaluated 
      within prospective studies. More studies on the relationship of the genotype with 
      drug pharmacokinetics and mechanism of action are also warranted. All these 
      studies, as well as further development and application of novel technologies to 
      decipher genetic alterations, might contribute to the validation of selected 
      polymorphisms as molecular markers predictive of drug activity and help in the 
      selection of TKIs best suited to the individual patient.

TI  - Regorafenib: a promising treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 1941-1948
LID - 10.1080/14656566.2018.1534956 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent 
      malignant tumors with 854,000 new cases per year and represents the second most 
      frequent cause of cancer-death. Despite surveillance, the number of patients that 
      are diagnosed at a stage in which they are eligible for curative treatments 
      ranges from 30% to 60%. Advanced HCC (BCLC-C) is characterized by a median 
      survival of 6 months. Sorafenib, the first systemic drug proven to be effective 
      in prolonging survival of unresectable HCC, was approved by the FDA in 2007 but 
      no second-line treatment was available for a decade for patients progressing on 
      sorafenib. Finally, in 2016, the RESORCE trial demonstrated regorafenib as an 
      effective second-line treatment. Areas covered: In this manuscript, the authors 
      review the principal preclinical and clinical trials on regorafenib used in the 
      treatment of unresectable HCC patients progressing on sorafenib and highlight 
      both the advantages and the limitations of this drug. Expert opinion: Regorafenib 
      is the only second-line treatment available for patients progressing on 
      sorafenib. Despite its promising clinical application, many doubts still remain, 
      necessitating further investigation to explore the tolerability of this drug in 
      Child-Pugh B and sorafenib-intolerant patients, while its scarce 
      cost-effectiveness must also be improved.

TI  - Phase I and clinical pharmacology study of bevacizumab, sorafenib, and low-dose 
      cyclophosphamide in children and young adults with refractory/recurrent solid 
      tumors.
PG  - 236-46
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1897 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities 
      (DLT), pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of sorafenib, bevacizumab, and 
      low-dose oral cyclophosphamide in children and young adults with 
      recurrent/refractory solid tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Sorafenib dose was 
      escalated from 90 to 110 mg/m(2) twice daily with fixed doses of bevacizumab at 5 
      mg/kg every 3 weeks and cyclophosphamide at 50 mg/m(2) daily. Once sorafenib's 
      MTD was established, bevacizumab dose was escalated. Each course was of 21 days. 
      Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics studies were conducted during the first 
      course. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (11 males; median age, 9.2 years) received a 
      median of four courses (range, 1-23). DLTs during course 1 included grade 3 rash 
      (two), increased lipase (one), anorexia (one), and thrombus (one). With an 
      additional 71 courses of therapy, the most common toxicities ≥ grade 3 included 
      neutropenia (nine), lymphopenia (nine), and rashes (four). Five of 17 evaluable 
      patients had partial tumor responses, and five had disease stabilization (>2 
      courses). Median day 1 cyclophosphamide apparent oral clearance was 3.13 
      L/h/m(2). Median day 1 sorafenib apparent oral clearance was 44 and 39 
      mL/min/m(2) at the 2 dose levels evaluated, and steady-state concentrations 
      ranged from 1.64 to 4.8 mg/L. Inhibition of serum VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) was 
      inversely correlated with sorafenib steady-state concentrations (P = 0.019). 
      CONCLUSION: The recommended phase II doses are sorafenib, 90 mg/m(2) twice daily; 
      bevacizumab, 15 mg/kg q3 weeks; and cyclophosphamide, 50 mg/m(2) once daily. This 
      regimen is feasible with promising evidence of antitumor activity that warrants 
      further investigation.

TI  - Pediatric phase I trial of oral sorafenib and topotecan in refractory or 
      recurrent pediatric solid malignancies.

AB  - Targeted kinase inhibitors and camptothecins have shown preclinical and clinical 
      activity in several cancers. This trial evaluated the maximum tolerated dose 
      (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities of sorafenib and topotecan administered orally 
      in pediatric patients with relapsed solid tumors. Sorafenib was administered 
      twice daily and topotecan once daily on days 1-5 and 8-12 of each 28-day course. 
      The study utilized a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design. Three dose levels 
      (DL) were evaluated: (1) sorafenib 150 mg/m(2) and topotecan 1 mg/m(2) ; (2) 
      sorafenib 150 mg/m(2) and topotecan 1.4 mg/m(2) ; and (3) sorafenib 200 mg/m(2) 
      and topotecan 1.4 mg/m(2) . Pharmacokinetics were ascertained and treatment 
      response assessed. Thirteen patients were enrolled. DL2 was the determined MTD. 
      Grade 4 thrombocytopenia delaying therapy for >7 days was observed in one of six 
      patients on DL2, and grade 4 neutropenia that delayed therapy in two of three 
      patients on DL3. A patient with preexisting cardiac failure controlled with 
      medication developed a transient drop in the left ventricular ejection fraction 
      that improved when sorafenib was withheld. Sorafenib exposure with or without 
      topotecan was comparable, and the concentration-time profiles for topotecan alone 
      and in combination with sorafenib were similar. One objective response was noted 
      in a patient with fibromatosis. We determined MTD to be sorafenib 150 mg/m(2) 
      twice daily orally on days 1-28 combined with topotecan 1.4 mg/m(2) once daily on 
      days 1-5 and 8-12. While these doses are 1 DL below the MTD of the agents 
      individually, pharmacokinetic studies suggested adequate drug exposure without 
      drug interactions. The combination had limited activity in the population 
      studied.

AB  - To support pharmacokinetic-guided dosing in individual patients, a fast and 
      accurate method for simultaneous determination of anticancer tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors (TKIs) dasatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, imatinib, lapatinib, 
      nilotinib, sorafenib and sunitinib in human plasma was developed using 
      high-performance liquid chromatography and detection with tandem mass 
      spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Stable isotopically labeled compounds of the eight 
      different TKIs were used as internal standards. Plasma proteins were precipitated 
      and an aliquot of supernatant was directly injected onto a reversed phase 
      chromatography system consisting of a Gemini C18 column (50 × 2.0 mm i.d., 5.0 µm 
      particle size) and then compounds were eluted with a gradient. The outlet of the 
      column was connected to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with electrospray 
      interface. Ions were detected in the positive multiple reaction monitoring mode. 
      This method was validated over a linear range from 20.0 to 10,000 ng/mL for 
      erlotinib, gefitinib, imatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib and sorafenib, and from 5.00 
      to 2500 ng/mL for dasatinib and sunitinib. Results from the validation study 
      demonstrated good intra- and inter-assay accuracy (<13.1%) and precision (10.0%) 
      for all analytes. This method was successfully applied for routine therapeutic 
      drug monitoring purposes in patients treated with the investigated TKIs.

TI  - Sarcopenia predicts early dose-limiting toxicities and pharmacokinetics of

PG  - e37563
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0037563 [doi]
LID - e37563
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib induces frequent dose limiting toxicities (DLT) in patients 
      with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sarcopenia has been associated with 
      poor performance status and shortened survival in cancer patients. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: The characteristics of Child Pugh A cirrhotic patients with HCC 
      receiving sorafenib in our institution were retrospectively analyzed. Sorafenib 
      plasma concentrations were determined at each visit. Toxicities were recorded 
      during the first month of treatment, and sarcopenia was determined from baseline 
      CT-scans. RESULTS: Forty patients (30 males) were included. Eleven (27.5%) were 
      sarcopenic. Eighteen patients (45%) experienced a DLT during the first month of 
      treatment. Sarcopenic patients experienced significantly more DLTs than 
      non-sarcopenic patients did (82% versus 31%, p = 0.005). Grade 3 diarrhea was 
      significantly more frequent in sarcopenic patients than in non-sarcopenic 
      patients (45.5% versus 6.9%, p = 0.01), but not grade 3 hand foot syndrome 
      reaction (9% versus 17.2%, p = 1). On day 28, median sorafenib AUC (n = 17) was 
      significantly higher in sarcopenic patients (102.4 mg/l.h versus 53.7 mg/l.h, p = 
      0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Among cirrhotic Child Pugh A patients with advanced HCC, 
      sarcopenia predicts sorafenib exposure and the occurrence of DLT within the first 
      month of treatment.

AB  - AIMS: Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), as drug delivery 
      vehicles, offer to eliminate the concerns associated with hydrophobic anti-cancer 
      agents. The current study was intended to fabricate a SPION based delivery system 
      for sorafenib that can simultaneously enable targeted delivery of sorafenib and 
      expand its therapeutic index against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MAIN 
      METHODS: Co-precipitation and physical entrapment methods were employed for the 
      synthesis of sorafenib loaded PVA coated SPIONs. Physicochemical 
      characterizations were done using TEM, XRD, FTIR, Raman spectra and VSM 
      measurements. The superior activity of nanoconjugate was demonstrated by AO/EB 
      staining, FACS, immunofluorescence and Western blot. The safety of the sorafenib 
      conjugated nanoparticles were verified in Wistar rats. KEY FINDINGS: The 
      synthesized nanoparticles were in the size range of 5-15 nm. The adsorption of 
      PVA to the SPIONs and the conjugation of sorafenib to the nanocarrier were 
      confirmed by XRD, FTIR and Raman spectra analyses. VSM study ascertained the 
      superparamagnetic nature of the nanoconjugate. Cellular uptake studies suggested 
      its efficient entrapment in HepG2 cells. MTT assay showed that the cytotoxicity 
      of sorafenib loaded PVA/SPIONs was comparable or higher than free sorafenib. The 
      activation of apoptosis and autophagy pathways in HepG2 by the nanoconjugate was 
      evidenced. Acute toxicity testing in Wistar rats supported the safe 
      administration of the nanoconjugate and established its localization in animal 
      tissues by Perl's Prussian Blue reaction. SIGNIFICANCE: The novel combination of 
      sorafenib with PVA/SPIONs showed better anticancer efficiency than free sorafenib 
      demonstrative of its potential in cancer chemotherapy.

AB  - To treat various cancers, including lung cancer, chemotherapy requires the 
      systematic administering of chemotherapy. The chemotherapeutic effectiveness of 
      anticancer drugs has been enhanced by polymer nanoparticles (NPs), according to 
      new findings. As an outcome, we have developed biodegradable triblock 
      poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone)-poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-PCL-PEG, 
      PECE) polymeric NPs for the co-delivery of sorafenib (SORA) and crizotinib (CRIZ) 
      and investigated their effect on lung cancer by in vitro and in vivo. There is 
      little polydispersity in the SORA-CRIZ@NPs, an average size of 30.45 ± 2.89 nm 
      range. A steady release of SORA and CRIZ was observed, with no burst impact. The 
      apoptosis rate of SORA-CRIZ@NPs was greater than that of free drugs in 4T1 and 
      A549 cells. Further, in vitro cytotoxicity of the polymeric NPs loaded with 
      potential anticancer drugs was more quickly absorbed by cancer cells. On the 
      other hand, compared to free drugs (SORA + CRIZ), SORA + CRIZ@NPs showed a 
      substantial reduction of tumor development, longer survival rate, and a lowered 
      side effect when delivered intravenously to nude mice xenograft model with 4T1 
      cancer cells. TUNEL positivity was also increased in tumor cells treated with 
      SORA-CRIZ@NPs, demonstrating the therapeutic effectiveness. SORA-CRIZ@NPs might 
      be used to treat lung cancer soon, based on the results from our new findings.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic interaction between sorafenib and prednisolone in a patient with 
      hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 269-72
LID - 10.1007/s00280-013-2187-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib is primarily metabolized in the liver, by CYP3A4-mediated 
      oxidation and UGT1A9-mediated glucuronidation. However, there is little 
      information about the pharmacokinetic interaction of sorafenib. Here, we report a 
      pharmacokinetic interaction between sorafenib and the CYP3A4 inducer prednisolone 
      in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 
      patient was a 72-year-old woman diagnosed with HCC. She was treated with 
      sorafenib at 400 mg daily. On day 9, sorafenib was discontinued due to drug 
      eruption. Nine months later, she was rechallenged with sorafenib at 400 mg daily 
      concurrently with oral prednisolone. Prednisolone was started at 20 mg daily and 
      was tapered by 5 mg every 14 days. We assessed the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib 
      and its major metabolite M-2. RESULTS: The concentration of sorafenib was 
      gradually increased following tapering of prednisolone. On day 56 after 
      rechallenge, she developed G3 oral mucositis. At this time, serum trough 
      concentrations of sorafenib and M-2 were at 5.9 and 1.1 μg/ml, respectively. 
      Consequently, sorafenib dosage was reduced to 200 mg daily, and the oral 
      mucositis was attenuated. The subsequent concentrations of sorafenib and M-2 
      obtained with a dose of 200 mg daily ranged from 1 to 3 μg/ml and from 0.1 to 0.4 
      μg/ml, respectively. Computed tomography scan showed a complete response of the 
      liver tumor with no further recurrence of the rash. CONCLUSIONS: We have 
      demonstrated for the first time that prednisolone stimulates the sorafenib 
      metabolism and that therapeutic drug monitoring could be useful during sorafenib 
      therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis is critical for tumour growth and metastasis. Dual 
      inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factors and platelet-derived growth 
      factor receptors suppresses angiogenesis. This expansion cohort of a phase I 
      study targeted angiogenesis with sorafenib, bevacizumab and low-dose 
      cyclophosphamide in children and young adults with recurrent solid tumours. 
      METHODS: An expansion cohort including patients with refractory or recurrent 
      solid tumours was enrolled and received bevacizumab (15 mg/kg IV, day 1), 
      sorafenib (90 mg/m(2) po twice daily, days 1-21) and low-dose cyclophosphamide 
      (50 mg/m(2) po daily, days 1-21). Each course was 21 days. Toxicities were 
      assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v3.0, and 
      responses were evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
      criteria. Serial bevacizumab pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were performed during 
      course 1. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (15 males; median age 14.5 yrs; range 
      1-22 yr) received a median of 6 courses (range 1-18). Twelve patients had a bone 
      or soft tissue sarcoma. The most common grade III/IV non-haematologic toxicities 
      were hypertension (N = 4), hand/foot rash (N = 3) and elevated lipase (N = 3). 
      The most common grade III/IV haematologic toxicities were neutropenia (N = 7) and 
      lymphopenia (N = 17). Three patients (2 synovial sarcoma, 1 rhabdoid tumour) 
      achieved a partial response and 18 had stable disease. The progression-free 
      survival at 3 and 6 months were 78.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 60.6-95.6%) 
      and 54% (95% CI 30.2-78.2%), respectively. Bevacizumab PKs in 15 patients was 
      similar to published adult PK results. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous bevacizumab 
      combined with oral sorafenib and low-dose cyclophosphamide was tolerated and 
      demonstrated promising activity in a subset of childhood solid tumours.

TI  - Relationship Between Adverse Events and Microbiomes in Advanced Hepatocellular 
      Carcinoma Patients Treated With Sorafenib.
PG  - 665-676
LID - 10.21873/anticanres.13996 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Sorafenib results in several adverse events, the mechanism and 
      predictors of which are unknown. Recently, it was reported that metabolism by 
      microbiome changes the structure and effects of drugs. The blood levels of 
      sorafenib may be affected by enterohepatic recycling of sorafenib due to 
      microbial enzymes in the gut. We evaluated the relationship between adverse 
      events caused by sorafenib treatment and microbiome in patients with advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients were 
      classified into two groups based on the presence of hand-foot syndrome (HFS) or 
      diarrhea within 12 weeks post-sorafenib treatment. Before sorafenib treatment, 
      the fecal samples were analyzed targeting the V3-V4 region of 16s ribosomal RNA. 
      Microbiome and predicted functional gene were compared between two groups. 
      RESULTS: The non-HFS group had a richer abundance of Veillonella, Bacillus, 
      Enterobacter, Faecalibacterium, Lachnospira, Dialister, and Anaerostipes than the 
      HFS group at genus level. Carotenoid biosynthesis and bacterial invasion of 
      epithelial cells were enriched in the HFS group. The former three bacteria are 
      classified as oral-origin bacteria, and the two predicted functions are 
      associated with dysbiosis. The non-diarrhea group had a higher abundance of 
      Butyricimonas and a lower abundance of Citrobacter, Peptostreptococcus, and 
      Staphylococcaceae than the diarrhea group. Eight categories of predicted 
      functional genes were detected with differences between the two groups. 
      CONCLUSION: The non-HFS group had a higher relative abundance of oral-origin 
      bacteria, which likely led to more robust dysbiosis in the gut. This dysbiosis 
      may affect enterohepatic recycling. Additionally, the metabolism of these 
      short-chain fatty acids in the gut may be different between the diarrhea and 
      non-diarrhea groups.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sorafenib is an unselective inhibitor of multiple kinases which has 
      demonstrated clinical advantage in renal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma. It 
      inhibits tumor proliferation by targeting receptor accessory factor (Raf) kinase 
      isoforms, inhibiting receptor tyrosine kinases of a variety of pro-angiogenic 
      factors and of several receptor tyrosine kinases involved in neovascularization 
      and tumor development. AREAS COVERED: This review offers an explanation of the 
      mechanism of action and of the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib, and gives readers a 
      complete overview of Phase I and II studies on the clinical efficacy, 
      tolerability and safety of this agent in the setting of ovarian cancer (OC) 
      treatment. EXPERT OPINION: The available results from the studies which 
      investigated the use of sorafenib for OC treatment demonstrated poor clinical 
      benefit either as single agent or in combination therapy. The most promising 
      results have been achieved combining sorafenib with bevacizumab, although 
      overlapping and cumulative toxicities should be taken in consideration. Research 
      should focus its attention to the development of reliable predictive biomarkers 
      to assess response and direct therapy in order to allow patient selection and 
      improving treatment schedules maximizing the clinical benefit and simultaneously 
      minimizing the toxicity related to the chemotherapy. Further studies are needed 
      to evaluate the role of sorafenib in the primary treatment of OC.

TI  - Phase I study of the combination of sorafenib and temsirolimus in patients with 
      metastatic melanoma.
PG  - 1120-8
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2436 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This phase I clinical trial was conducted to determine the safety, 
      efficacy, and molecular effects of sorafenib with temsirolimus in patients with 
      advanced melanoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage IV or unresectable 
      or recurrent stage III melanoma and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
      performance status of 0 to 1 were eligible. Sorafenib was given orally once or 
      twice daily and temsirolimus was given i.v. weekly, both starting on day 1, with 
      a 4-week cycle. Responses were assessed every 2 cycles per Response Evaluation 
      Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria. Consenting patients with accessible tumors 
      underwent optional tumor biopsies before treatment and after the second infusion 
      of temsirolimus. Tumor biopsies were analyzed for activating mutations in BRAF 
      and NRAS, and for expression of P-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (P-ERK) 
      and P-S6 proteins. RESULTS: A total of 25 patients were accrued to the study. The 
      maximum tolerated doses were sorafenib 400 mg every morning and 200 mg every 
      evening and temsirolimus 25 mg i.v. weekly. Dose-limiting toxicities included 
      thrombocytopenia, hand-foot syndrome, serum transaminase elevation, and 
      hypertriglyceridemia. There were no complete or partial responses with the 
      combination; 10 patients achieved stabilization of disease as their best 
      response. The median progression-free survival was 2.1 months. Matching 
      pretreatment and day 15 tumor biopsies showed marked inhibition of P-S6 with 
      treatment in 3 of 4 evaluable patients, but minimal inhibition of P-ERK. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy with sorafenib and temsirolimus resulted in 
      significant toxicity at higher dose levels, failed to achieve any clinical 
      responses in genetically unselected patient population, and did not inhibit 
      P-ERK.

TI  - Organic anion transport polypeptide 1b2 selectively affects the pharmacokinetic 
      interaction between paclitaxel and sorafenib in rats.

AB  - Paclitaxel, a broad-spectrum antitumor drug, is widely used as a cytotoxic drug, 
      while sorafenib as a multi-kinase inhibitor is a classic targeted drug. A number 
      of clinical trials have combined paclitaxel and sorafenib for cancer treatment, 
      with the expectation of better therapeutic effects. However, the toxicity and 
      side effects in the treatment are significantly increased. In this report, the 
      organic anion transport polypeptide 1b2 (Oatp1b2) overexpression cell model and 
      the Oatp1b2 knockout (KO) rat model were used to investigate the drug-drug 
      interactions (DDI) between paclitaxel and sorafenib. In Oatp1b2-overexpressed 
      cells, sorafenib inhibited the uptake of paclitaxel in a concentration-dependent 
      manner. In wild-type (WT) rats, sorafenib increased the systemic exposure and 
      slowed the elimination of paclitaxel, resulting in DDI. In Oatp1b2 KO rats, 
      however, the DDI disappeared. Interestingly, paclitaxel did not alter the 
      pharmacokinetic profiles of sorafenib. Further studies found that sorafenib was 
      not the substrate of Oatp1b2 in rats. In general, the combination of paclitaxel 
      and sorafenib caused Oatp1b2-mediated DDI in vitro and in vivo, because sorafenib 
      inhibited Oatp1b2 activity and affected the pharmacokinetic properties of 
      paclitaxel. This study may provide useful information for understanding the role 
      of OATP1B in paclitaxel-sorafenib interaction.

TI  - Sorafenib and everolimus in patients with advanced solid tumors and KRAS-mutated 
      NSCLC: A phase I trial with early pharmacodynamic FDG-PET assessment.
PG  - 4991-5007
LID - 10.1002/cam4.3131 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of patients with solid tumors and KRAS mutations remains 
      disappointing. One option is the combined inhibition of pathways involved in 
      RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR. METHODS: Patients with relapsed solid tumors were 
      treated with escalating doses of everolimus (E) 2.5-10.0 mg/d in a 14-day run-in 
      phase followed by combination therapy with sorafenib (S) 800 mg/d from day 15. 
      KRAS mutational status was assessed retrospectively in the escalation phase. 
      Extension phase included KRAS-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) only. 
      Pharmacokinetic analyses were accompanied by pharmacodynamics assessment of E by 
      FDG-PET. Efficacy was assessed by CT scans every 6 weeks of combination. RESULTS: 
      Of 31 evaluable patients, 15 had KRAS mutation, 4 patients were negative for KRAS 
      mutation, and the KRAS status remained unknown in 12 patients. Dose-limiting 
      toxicity (DLT) was not reached. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as 
      7.5 mg/d E + 800 mg/d S due to toxicities at previous dose level (10 mg/d 
      E + 800 mg/d S) including leucopenia/thrombopenia III° and pneumonia III° 
      occurring after the DLT interval. The metabolic response rate in FDG-PET was 17% 
      on day 5 and 20% on day 14. No patient reached partial response in CT scan. 
      Median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.25 and 
      5.85 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of patients with relapsed solid 
      tumors with 7.5 mg/d E and 800 mg/d S is safe and feasible. Early metabolic 
      response in FDG-PET was not confirmed in CT scan several weeks later. The 
      combination of S and E is obviously not sufficient to induce durable responses in 
      patients with KRAS-mutant solid tumors.

TI  - Safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of donafenib in treating advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma: report from a phase 1b trial.
PG  - 688-693
LID - 10.1691/ph.2019.9626 [doi]
AB  - Background: Donafenib is a novel compound similar to sorafenib that functions as 
      a multikinase inhibitor. This phase 1b trial aimed to assess the safety, 
      pharmacokinetics and efficacy of donafenib in treating Chinese patients with 
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: From July 2014 to April 2015, 27 
      eligible advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients were enrolled in the trial. 
      They were randomly divided into 200 mg and 300 mg bid groups and received these 
      oral doses of donafenib until the appearance of intolerance or disease 
      progression. Results: Overall, donafenib was safe and well tolerated in the two 
      groups, and most adverse events were grade 1 or 2. Elevated transaminase (n=19, 
      70.4 %), hypocalcemia (n=19, 70.4 %), and skin toxicity (n=17, 63.0 %) were the 
      most frequently encountered adverse events. Donafenib exhibited high variability 
      in pharmacokinetic parameters. Areas under the plasma concentration-time curve 
      from 0-12 h increased disproportionally to the dose escalation. The treatment 
      resulted in partial response in two patients and a stable disease status in 17 
      patients, and the median time to progression was 120 days for both groups. 
      Conclusion: The results from this phase 1b trial indicate a favorable safety 
      profile and notable anticancer efficacy of donafenib for treating advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Comparable or better safety and efficacy were observed 
      for a lower dosage of donafenib compared with sorafenib in the literature.

TI  - Results from an in vitro and a clinical/pharmacological phase I study with the 
      combination irinotecan and sorafenib.
PG  - 55-63
AB  - PURPOSE: This single-centre, open-label, phase I dose-escalation study was 
      performed to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of 
      sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, combined with irinotecan, a cytotoxic agent, 
      in patients with advanced, refractory solid tumours. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In an 
      initial dose-escalation phase, patients received irinotecan 125 mg/m(2) and 
      sorafenib 100, 200 and 400 mg twice daily (bid) (cohorts 1-3). In an extended 
      phase, colorectal cancer (CRC) patients received fixed-dose irinotecan 140 mg and 
      sorafenib 400 mg bid (cohort 4). RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were treated: 20 
      in the dose-escalation phase (common tumour types: CRC [45%], ovarian [5%], 
      pancreatic [5%]) and 14 patients in the CRC extension. Frequent drug-related 
      adverse events were gastrointestinal symptoms, dermatological reactions and 
      constitutional symptoms. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Generally, 
      concomitant administration of irinotecan had no impact on the PK of sorafenib. 
      Sorafenib 100 or 200 mg bid had no impact on the PK of irinotecan or its 
      metabolite SN38. In contrast, sorafenib 400 mg bid significantly increased 
      irinotecan and SN38 exposures; however, this was not associated with increased 
      toxicities. Stable disease was achieved in 12/20 (60%) evaluable patients in 
      cohorts 1-3, and 10/13 (77%) evaluable patients in cohort 4. A further patient 
      from cohort 4 had a partial response of >200 days. The increase of SN38 exposure 
      might be due to inhibition of formation of the SN38 glucuronide by sorafenib. In 
      vitro, sorafenib strongly inhibited SN38 glucuronidation in human liver 
      microsomes as indicated by a K(i) value of 2.7 micromol/l. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib 
      400 mg bid can be combined with irinotecan 125 mg/m(2) or 140 mg for the 
      treatment of patients with advanced, refractory solid tumours, although 
      monitoring for toxicity is recommended.

TI  - Interaction of sorafenib and cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in patients with advanced 
      melanoma: a phase I/II pharmacokinetic interaction study.
PG  - 1111-8
LID - 10.1007/s00280-011-1585-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In vitro data indicate that the sorafenib is a moderate inhibitor of 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. This phase 
      I/II study in patients with advanced melanoma evaluated the potential effect of 
      sorafenib on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, omeprazole, and dextromethorphan, 
      specific substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, respectively. METHODS: 
      Twenty-one patients received sorafenib 400 mg twice daily for 28 consecutive 
      days. On days 1 and 28, a cocktail containing midazolam 2 mg, omeprazole 20 mg, 
      and dextromethorphan 30 mg was administered. Pharmacokinetic analyses were 
      performed on day 1 without sorafenib and day 28 after steady-state sorafenib 
      exposure; sorafenib pharmacokinetics were evaluated on day 28. We defined an 
      interaction to be excluded if the 90% confidence interval of the ratio of all day 
      28:day 1 analyses fell within a range from 0.80 to 1.25. RESULTS: In all, 18 
      patients were evaluable. On day 28, area under the plasma concentration-time 
      curve from time 0 to 12 h (AUC(0-12)) and maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) 
      for sorafenib were 38.1 mg h/l and 4.9 mg/l, respectively. Day 28:day 1 ratios 
      for AUC from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-inf)) and C(max) for 
      midazolam were 0.85 and 0.98, respectively. Day 28:day 1 ratio for 
      5-OH-omeprazole:omeprazole plasma concentration at 3 h postdose was 1.26, 
      slightly outside of the 0.80-1.25 range. Thus, an interaction could not be 
      excluded, but is considered unlikely to be clinically significant. Day 28:day 1 
      ratio for dextromethorphan:dextrorphan concentration in urine was 0.94. Sorafenib 
      had an acceptable safety profile. The most frequently observed grade 3-4 
      toxicities in cycle 1 included elevated lipase (19%) and hypertension (10%). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this patient population, our results demonstrate that exposures 
      of probes of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C19 activity are potentially altered by 
      administration of sorafenib at 400 mg twice daily. However, these differences are 
      sufficiently small that a clinically significant inhibition or induction of these 
      important drug metabolizing P450 isoenzymes is unlikely. Clinical and, where 
      possible, drug level monitoring may still be appropriate for drugs of narrow 
      therapeutic range co-administered with sorafenib.

AB  - Lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles (LPHNPs) have been merged as potential 
      nanocarriers for treatment of cancer. In the present study, LPHNPs loaded with 
      Sorafenib (SFN) were prepared with PLGA, Lecithin and DSPE-PEG 2000 by using the 
      bulk nanoprecipitation and microfluidic (MF) co-flow nanoprecipitation 
      techniques. Herein, a glass capillary microfluidic device was primed to optimize 
      the LPHNPs and compared to the bulk nanoprecipitation method. The morphological 
      analysis of prepared LPHNPs revealed the well-defined spherical nano-sized 
      particles in bulk nanoprecipitation method. Whereas, core shell morphology was 
      observed in the MF method. The formulation prepared by the MF method (MF1-MF3) 
      indicated relatively higher % EE (95.0%, 93.8% and 88.7%) and controlled release 
      of the SFN from the particles as compared to the LPHNPs obtained by the bulk 
      nanoprecipitation method. However, the release of SFN from all LPHNP formulation 
      followed Higuchi model (R(2) = 0.9901-0.9389) with Fickian diffusion mechanism. 
      Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Differential scanning calorimetry 
      (DSC) and powder X-rays diffraction (pXRD) studies depicted the compatibility of 
      SFN with all the structural components. In addition, the colloidal stability, in 
      vitro cytotoxicity and cell growth inhibition studies of LPHNPs also demonstrated 
      stability in biological media, biocompatibility and safety with enhanced 
      anti-proliferative effects than the free SFN in breast cancer and prostate cancer 
      cells. In conclusion, LPHNPs provided a prospective platform for the cancer 
      chemotherapy and substantially improved the knowledge of fabrication and 
      optimization of the hybrid nanoparticles.

AB  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a highly vascularized tumor and prone to distant 
      metastasis. Sorafenib is the first targeted multikinase inhibitor and first-line 
      chemical drug approved for RCC therapy. In fact, only a small number of RCC 
      patients benefit significantly from sorafenib treatment, while the growing 
      prevalence of sorafenib resistance has become a major obstacle for drug therapy 
      effectivity of sorafenib. The molecular mechanisms of sorafenib resistance in RCC 
      are not completely understood by now. Herein, we comprehensively summarize the 
      underlying mechanisms of sorafenib resistance and molecular biomarkers for 
      predicting sorafenib responsiveness. Moreover, we outline strategies suitable for 
      overcoming sorafenib resistance and prospect potential approaches for identifying 
      biomarkers associated with sorafenib resistance in RCC, which contributes to 
      guide individualized and precision drug therapy.

TI  - A polymeric nanoformulation improves the bioavailability and efficacy of 
      sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma therapy.
PG  - 2508-2518
LID - 10.1039/d0bm01881c [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death 
      worldwide. Sorafenib (sfb) is widely used in clinics for advanced HCC therapy. 
      However, the therapeutic efficacy of sfb is suboptimal due to its poor water 
      solubility, low bioavailability, and side effects. Here, we employed a clinically 
      safe polymer poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactic acid) (PEG-b-PLA) to prepare a 
      nanoparticle (NP)-based sfb formulation (NP-sfb) and tested its antitumor effect 
      in multiple HCC models. NP-sfb could achieve effective drug loading and remain 
      stable under physiological conditions. NP-sfb could be taken up by HepG2, 
      Hepa1-6, and H22 cells and could efficiently inhibit cell proliferation and/or 
      promote cell apoptosis. In vivo studies indicated that NP-sfb showed 
      significantly improved therapeutic efficacy compared with free-sfb at the same 
      dose or even higher doses. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that NP-sfb not only 
      inhibited tumor proliferation and angiogenesis but also stimulated the tumor 
      microenvironment by reducing the infiltration of immunosuppressive myeloid cells 
      and increasing the ratio of cytotoxic T cells. This study demonstrates that the 
      NP-based formulation is a promising strategy to improve the clinical application 
      of sfb.

TI  - Sorafenib-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers for topical ocular therapy of 
      corneal neovascularization: development, in-vitro and in vivo study.
PG  - 837-855
LID - 10.1080/10717544.2022.2048134 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib (SRB), a multikinase inhibitor, is effective in reducing experimental 
      corneal neovascularization (CNV) after oral administration; however, its 
      therapeutic use in ocular surface disorders is restricted due to poor solubility 
      and limited bioavailability. This study aimed to develop and optimize SRB-loaded 
      nanostructured lipid carriers (SRB-NLCs) for topical ocular delivery by a central 
      composite design response surface methodology (CCD-RSM). It was spherical and 
      uniform in morphology with an average particle size of 111.87 ± 0.93 nm and a 
      narrow size distribution. The in vitro drug release from the released SRB-NLC 
      formulation was well fitted to Korsmeyer Peppas release kinetics. The cell 
      counting kit-8 (CCK-8) cell viability assay demonstrated that SRB-NLC was not 
      obviously cytotoxic to human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs). An in vivo ocular 
      irritation test showed that SRB-NLC was well tolerated by rabbit eyes. Ocular 
      pharmacokinetics revealed 6.79-fold and 1.24-fold increase in the area under 
      concentration-time curves (AUC(0-12h)) over 12 h in rabbit cornea and 
      conjunctiva, respectively, treated with one dose of SRB-NLC compared with those 
      treated with SRB suspension. Moreover, SRB-NLC (0.05% SRB) and dexamethasone 
      (0.025%) similarly suppressed corneal neovascularization in mice. In conclusion, 
      the optimized SRB-NLC formulation demonstrated excellent physicochemical 
      properties and good tolerance, sustained release, and enhanced ocular 
      bioavailability. It is safe and potentially effective for the treatment of 
      corneal neovascularization.

AB  - A new liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method, performed 
      by electrospray ionization in positive mode using a triple quadrupole mass 
      spectrometry, has been developed and validated for the simultaneous determination 
      of bortezomib (BORT), dasatinib (DASA), imatinib (IMAT), nilotinib (NILO), 
      erlotinib (ERLO), lapatinib (LAPA), sorafenib (SORA), sunitinib (SUNI) and 
      vandetanib (VAND) in human plasma. Separation is achieved on an Hypersil Gold(®) 
      PFP column using a gradient elution of 10mM ammonium formate containing 0.1% 
      formic acid (A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid (B) at a flow rate 
      of 0.3 mL/min. After addition of the internal standard and protein precipitation, 
      the supernatant is diluted 2-fold in a mixture A and B (50/50, v/v). Two selected 
      reaction monitoring transitions are used for each analyte: one is used for 
      quantitation, the second one is used for confirmation. The standard curves are 
      ranged from 2 ng/mL to 250 ng/mL for BORT, DASA and SUNI and from 50 ng/mL to 
      3500 ng/mL for the others and were fitted to a 1/x weighted linear regression 
      model. The lowest limits of quantification were 2 ng/mL for BORT, DASA and SUNI 
      and 50 ng/mL for the other TKIs. The method also showed satisfactory results in 
      terms of sensitivity, specificity, precision (intra- and inter-day RSD from 3.7% 
      to 13.8%), accuracy (from 86.8% to 113.5%), recovery as well as stability of the 
      analytes under various conditions. The method also may contribute to better 
      understand the relationship between pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of TKIs 
      in hematological malignancies and solid tumors.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the safety and tolerability of the small-molecule allosteric 
      MEK inhibitor refametinib combined with sorafenib, in patients with advanced 
      solid malignancies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This phase I dose-escalation study 
      included an expansion phase at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Patients 
      received refametinib/sorafenib twice daily for 28 days, from a dose of 
      refametinib 5 mg plus sorafenib 200 mg to a dose of refametinib 50 mg plus 
      sorafenib 400 mg. Plasma levels of refametinib, refametinib metabolite M17, and 
      sorafenib were measured for pharmacokinetic assessments. Tumors were biopsied at 
      the MTD for analysis of MEK pathway mutations and ERK phosphorylation. RESULTS: 
      Thirty-two patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation cohort. The MTD was 
      refametinib 50 mg twice daily plus sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. The most common 
      treatment-related toxicities were diarrhea and fatigue. Refametinib was readily 
      absorbed following oral administration (plasma half-life of ∼16 hours at the 
      MTD), and pharmacokinetic parameters displayed near-dose proportionality, with 
      less than 2-fold accumulation after multiple dosing. Another 30 patients were 
      enrolled in the MTD cohort; 19 had hepatocellular carcinoma. The combination was 
      associated with significantly reduced ERK phosphorylation in 5 out of 6 patients 
      biopsied, with the greatest reductions in those with KRAS or BRAF mutations. 
      Disease was stabilized in approximately half of patients, and 1 patient with 
      colorectal cancer achieved a partial response at the MTD lasting approximately 1 
      year. CONCLUSIONS: In this phase I study, refametinib plus sorafenib was well 
      tolerated, with good oral absorption, near-dose proportionality, and target 
      inhibition in a range of tumor types. Clin Cancer Res; 22(10); 2368-76. ©2015

TI  - Hepatocellular Shuttling and Recirculation of Sorafenib-Glucuronide Is Dependent 
      on Abcc2, Abcc3, and Oatp1a/1b.
PG  - 2729-36
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-0280 [doi]
AB  - Recently, an efficient liver detoxification process dubbed "hepatocyte hopping" 
      was proposed on the basis of findings with the endogenous compound, bilirubin 
      glucuronide. According to this model, hepatocytic bilirubin glucuronide can 
      follow a liver-to-blood shuttling loop via Abcc3 transporter-mediated efflux and 
      subsequent Oatp1a/1b-mediated liver uptake. We hypothesized that glucuronide 
      conjugates of xenobiotics, such as the anticancer drug sorafenib, can also 
      undergo hepatocyte hopping. Using transporter-deficient mouse models, we show 
      here that sorafenib-glucuronide can be extruded from hepatocytes into the bile by 
      Abcc2 or back into the systemic circulation by Abcc3, and that it can be taken up 
      efficiently again into neighboring hepatocytes by Oatp1a/1b. We further 
      demonstrate that sorafenib-glucuronide excreted into the gut lumen can be cleaved 
      by microbial enzymes to sorafenib, which is then reabsorbed, supporting its 
      persistence in the systemic circulation. Our results suggest broad relevance of a 
      hepatocyte shuttling process known as "hepatocyte hopping"-a novel concept in 
      clinical pharmacology-for detoxification of targeted cancer drugs that undergo 
      hepatic glucuronidation, such as sorafenib.

TI  - Preclinical efficacy of a novel dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, CMG002, alone and in 
      combination with sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 809-817
LID - 10.1007/s00280-019-03918-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib has been the only first systemic drug that improves survival 
      of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, because the 
      response rate of sorafenib is relatively low, novel therapeutic strategies are 
      needed to improve survival in patients with HCC. This study investigated the 
      effect of CMG002 alone and in combination with sorafenib on HCC in vitro and 
      vivo. METHODS: The effect of a newly developed dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, CMG002, 
      on the proliferation of Huh-7 and HepG2 HCC cells was investigated using the MTT 
      assay. Western blotting was performed to assess phosphorylation of the key 
      enzymes in the Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. HepG2 cells were 
      inoculated into mice, which were treated with vehicle, sorafenib, CMG002, and 
      their combinations. Tumor cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis were 
      evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis of Ki-67 and CD31, respectively. Tumor 
      cell apoptosis was detected by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP 
      nick end labeling assay. Levels of key enzymes in the Ras/Raf/MAPK and 
      PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways were evaluated by western blot analysis. RESULTS: The 
      combination of sorafenib and CMG002 additively inhibited Huh-7 and HepG2 cell 
      proliferation compared to single-agent treatment. Sorafenib and CMG002 as single 
      agents differentially inhibited or activated key enzymes in the Ras/Raf/MAPK and 
      PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. The combination of sorafenib and CMG002 inhibited all key 
      enzymes in the two pathways. Treatment with CMG002 for 4 weeks alone and in 
      combination with sorafenib strongly inhibited tumor growth. CMG002 inhibited HCC 
      cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and decreased tumor angiogenesis. 
      Furthermore, these effects were enhanced when CMG002 was combined with sorafenib. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The combination of CMG002 and sorafenib significantly inhibited HCC 
      cell proliferation and tumorigenesis by inhibiting the Ras/Raf/MAPK and 
      PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. These findings suggest that CMG002 to be a potential 
      novel candidate treatment for HCC.

TI  - Sorafenib, but not sunitinib, affects function of dendritic cells and induction 
      of primary immune responses.

AB  - The tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib and sunitinib are approved for the 
      treatment of patients with malignant diseases. To analyze the possible use of 
      these compounds in combination with immunotherapeutic approaches, we analyzed the 
      effects of both inhibitors on the immunostimulatory capacity of human dendritic 
      cells (DCs) and the induction of primary immune responses in vivo. Sorafenib, but 
      not sunitinib, inhibits function of DCs, characterized by reduced secretion of 
      cytokines and expression of CD1a, major histocompatibility complex, and 
      costimulatory molecules in response to TLR ligands as well as by their impaired 
      ability to migrate and stimulate T-cell responses. These inhibitory effects are 
      mediated by inhibition of PI3 and MAP kinases and NFkappaB signaling. In 
      contrast, sorafenib had no influence on the phenotype and proliferation of T 
      cells. To analyze the effects of both TKIs on cytotoxic T-cell induction in vivo, 
      C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with sorafenib or sunitinib and immunized with 
      OVA(257-264) peptide. Sorafenib, but not sunitinib, application significantly 
      reduced the induction of antigen-specific T cells. Numbers of regulatory T cells 
      were reduced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from mice treated with 
      sunitinib. These results indicate that sunitinib, but not sorafenib, is suitable 
      for combination with immunotherapeutic approaches for treatment of cancer 
      patients.

AB  - Combination with chemotherapeutic drug and gene therapy has been proven highly 
      effective in suppressing tumor progression. Hence, an asialoglycoprotein receptor 
      (ASGPR)-targeting nanodrug delivery system based on mesoporous silica (MSN) 
      nanocarrier for co-delivery of sorafenib (SO) and vascular endothelial growth 
      factor (VEGF) targeted siRNA (siVEGF) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was 
      successfully designed and synthesized. The structure of nanoparticles was 
      characterized by IR, particle size, zeta potential and N2 adsorption-desorption. 
      The nanoparticles were further evaluated for drug release, cellular uptake, 
      transfection, cell cytotoxicity and cell cycle against HepG2 and Huh7 cells. In 
      vitro testing demonstrated that MSN-LA delivery system could not only induce S 
      cell cycle arrest, enhance the cytotoxicity and improve the tumor target of SO 
      and siVEGF, but also enhance the siVEGF transfection efficiency in 
      ASGPR-overexpressing Huh7 cells. Overall, the MSN-LA delivery system can be a 
      promising drug carrier which could further enhance the anti-cancer efficacy of SO 
      and siVEGF via the active targeting property of LA.

TI  - Phase 2 trial of sorafenib in children and young adults with refractory solid 
      tumors: A report from the Children's Oncology Group.
PG  - 1562-6
LID - 10.1002/pbc.25548 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib is an oral small molecule inhibitor of multiple kinases 
      controlling tumor growth and angiogenesis. The purpose of the phase 2 study was 
      to determine the response rate of sorafenib and gain further information on the 
      associated toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of sorafenib in 
      children and young adults with relapsed or refractory tumors including 
      rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms tumor, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and papillary 
      thyroid carcinoma (PTC). PROCEDURE: Sorafenib, 200 mg/m(2) /dose, was 
      administered every 12 hr continuously for 28 day cycles using a two-stage design 
      in two primary strata (rhabdomyosarcoma and Wilms tumor) and two secondary strata 
      (HCC and PTC). Correlative studies in consenting patients included determination 
      of sorafenib steady state trough concentrations and assessments of VEGF and 
      sVEGFR2. RESULTS: Twenty patients (median age of 11 years; range, 5-21) enrolled. 
      No objective responses (RECIST) were observed in the 10 evaluable patients 
      enrolled in each of the two primary disease strata of rhabdomyosarcoma and Wilms 
      tumor. No patients with HCC or PTC were enrolled. Sorafenib was not associated 
      with an excessive rate of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The mean ± SD steady 
      state concentration during cycle 1 day 15 was 6.5 ± 3.9 μg/ml (n = 10). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib was well tolerated in children at 200 mg/m(2) /dose twice 
      daily on a continuous regimen with toxicity profile and steady state drug 
      concentrations similar to those previously reported. Single agent sorafenib was 
      inactive in children with recurrent or refractory rhabdomyosarcoma or Wilms 
      tumor.

TI  - A phase 1 study of everolimus and sorafenib for metastatic clear cell renal cell 
      carcinoma.
PG  - 4194-200
LID - 10.1002/cncr.25931 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to assess the maximum tolerated dose 
      (MTD), safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor effect of everolimus, 
      a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, in combination with sorafenib, a 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell 
      carcinoma. METHODS: Sequential cohorts of patients received escalating doses of 
      everolimus and sorafenib in 28-day cycles in the absence of a dose-limiting 
      toxicity (DLT) or disease progression were examined. RESULTS: Twenty patients 
      with a median age of 65 years received therapy in 3 cohorts. Dose level 1 was 
      comprised of everolimus at a dose of 2.5 mg daily and sorafenib at a dose of 400 
      mg twice daily (6 patients), dose level 2 was comprised of everolimus at a dose 
      of 5 mg daily and sorafenib at a dose of 400 mg twice daily (8 patients), and 
      dose level 3 was comprised of everolimus at a dose of 10 mg daily and sorafenib 
      at a dose of 200 mg twice daily (6 patients). DLTs included grade 4 (according to 
      National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 
      3.0]) hyperuricemia with grade 2 gout and grade 3 lipase associated with grade 2 
      pancreatitis at dose level 2, and grade 3 rash in 2 patients at dose level 3. 
      Dose level 2 (everolimus at a dose of 5 mg daily and sorafenib at a dose of 400 
      mg twice daily) was established as the maximum tolerated dose. Treatment-related 
      adverse events occurring in >20% of patients included diarrhea, hand-foot 
      syndrome, hypertension, hypophosphatemia, hypothyroidism, and rash. Five of 20 
      patients achieved Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)-defined 
      partial responses, all of which occurred in patients without a history of prior 
      systemic therapy. Seven of 8 patients treated at dose level 2 experienced a 
      partial response or stable disease. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no 
      interaction between everolimus and sorafenib. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of 
      everolimus and sorafenib was associated with acceptable toxicity and evidence of 
      antitumor activity in previously untreated patients with metastatic renal cell 
      carcinoma.

TI  - Exposure-toxicity relationship of sorafenib in Japanese patients with renal cell 
      carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 185-96
LID - 10.1007/s40262-013-0108-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sorafenib has various adverse events that can cause 
      treatment discontinuation or dose reduction. The aim of this study was to compare 
      the safety profile between renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) patients receiving sorafenib under real-life practice conditions. 
      Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between sorafenib exposure and 
      clinical outcomes. METHODS: A total of 91 Japanese cancer patients (RCC, n = 21; 
      HCC, n = 70) treated with sorafenib were enrolled. Toxicity was graded according 
      to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events 
      (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.0. Single blood samples were collected at each clinic visit 
      and serum sorafenib concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem 
      mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The incidence of adverse events was analyzed 
      according to cancer type and sorafenib concentration. RESULTS: Hand-foot skin 
      reaction (HFSR) was the most common adverse event among RCC (76 %) and HCC (66 %) 
      patients. Elevations in hepatic transaminases and pancreatic amylase developed 
      more frequently in patients with RCC than in those with HCC (p < 0.05), while 
      hyperbilirubinemia and thrombocytopenia were observed more often in HCC patients 
      than in RCC patients (p < 0.05). Pharmacokinetic data were available from 52 
      patients (RCC, n = 16; HCC, n = 36). HCC patients showed significantly higher 
      dose-normalized concentrations than RCC patients (p = 0.0184). Sorafenib 
      concentrations were significantly greater in patients with grade ≥2 HFSR and 
      hypertension than in those not experiencing the adverse events (p = 0.0045 and 
      0.0453, respectively). Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic curves 
      revealed optimal cutoff concentrations of sorafenib to predict grade ≥2 HFSR 
      (5.78 μg/mL) and hypertension (4.78 μg/mL). In addition, a trend of prolonged 
      overall survival was observed in HCC patients who achieved a maximal sorafenib 
      concentration of ≥4.78 μg/mL during treatment compared with those who did not 
      achieve the threshold concentration (12.0 vs. 6.5 months; log-rank p = 0.0824). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the safety and 
      pharmacokinetic profiles of sorafenib differ between Japanese cancer patients 
      with RCC and HCC. Furthermore, the serum sorafenib concentration could be used as 
      a guide to avoiding the development of severe HFSR while allowing prediction of 
      the incidence of grade ≥2 hypertension in patients with RCC and HCC, and may 
      potentially be related to the clinical efficacy of sorafenib for HCC.

TI  - Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of sorafenib in patients with hepatic or renal 
      dysfunction: CALGB 60301.
PG  - 1800-5
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2008.20.0931 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We sought to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and determine a 
      tolerable dose of oral sorafenib in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were assigned to one of nine cohorts: cohort 1, 
      bilirubin < or = upper limit of normal (ULN) and AST < or = ULN and creatinine 
      clearance (CC) > or = 60 mL/min; cohort 2, bilirubin more than ULN but < or = 
      1.5x ULN and/or AST more than ULN; cohort 3, CC between 40 and 59 mL/min; cohort 
      4, bilirubin more than 1.5x ULN to < or = 3x ULN (any AST); cohort 5, CC between 
      20 and 39 mL/min; cohort 6, bilirubin more than 3x ULN to 10x ULN (any AST); 
      cohort 7, CC less than 20 mL/min; cohort 8, albumin less than 2.5 mg/dL (any 
      bilirubin/AST); and cohort 9, hemodialysis. Sorafenib was administered as a 
      400-mg dose on day 1 for PK, and continuous daily dosing started on day 8. 
      RESULTS: Of 150 registered patients, 138 patients were treated. With the 
      exception of cohorts 6 and 7, at least 12 patients per cohort were assessable, 
      and the dose level with prospectively defined dose-limiting toxicity in less than 
      one third of patients by day 29 was considered tolerable. No significant 
      associations between the sorafenib PK and cohort were found. CONCLUSION: We 
      recommend the following empiric sorafenib starting doses by cohort: cohort 1, 400 
      mg twice a day; cohort 2, 400 mg twice a day; cohort 3, 400 mg twice a day; 
      cohort 4, 200 mg twice a day; cohort 5, 200 mg twice a day; cohort 6, not even 
      200 mg every third day tolerable; cohort 7, not defined; cohort 8, 200 mg each 
      day; and cohort 9, 200 mg each day.

TI  - Fluvastatin enhances sorafenib cytotoxicity in melanoma cells via modulation of 
      AKT and JNK signaling pathways.
PG  - 3259-65
AB  - Most metastatic melanomas are refractory to current available therapy, 
      underscoring the need to identify new effective treatments. Sorafenib, a 
      multikinase inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, 
      showed promise in earlier stages of clinical development, but ultimately failed 
      to demonstrate efficacy as a single agent in the treatment of melanoma. In order 
      to enhance the efficacy of sorafenib in the treatment of melanoma, we tested over 
      2,000 naturally occurring compounds and marketed drugs in the presence of 
      sorafenib in chemoresistant human melanoma cell lines also resistant to 
      sorafenib-induced apoptosis. Of the 9 compounds identified as sorafenib 
      sensitizers, we prioritized the cholesterol-lowering agent fluvastatin, based on 
      its favorable pharmacokinetics and safety profile. Our results demonstrate that 
      fluvastatin at 1 μM, a level safely achieved through oral administration, 
      dramatically enhances the growth-inhibitory activity of clinically achievable 
      concentrations of sorafenib in M14 and SKM-173 melanoma cells, with a 3.2- and 
      3.6-fold reduction in sorafenib 50% growth inhibition (GI50), respectively. 
      Similar effects were observed for other melanoma cell lines. Combination indices 
      analysis revealed a synergistic relationship between the two agents. Fluvastatin 
      enhances sorafenib-mediated apoptosis as revealed through enhanced cleavage of 
      poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. In combination with sorafenib, fluvastatin 
      treatment results in reduced levels of activated murine thymoma viral oncogene 
      homolog along with enhanced levels of activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase. 
      Sensitization to sorafenib is unique to fluvastatin, as other statins 
      (pravastatin and simvastatin) do not enhance sorafenib-mediated growth 
      inhibition. These promising results warrant further investigation into the 
      clinical applicability of fluvastatin as an agent for enhancing the efficacy of 
      sorafenib in the treatment of melanoma.

TI  - Tivozanib: status of development.
PG  - 24
LID - 10.1007/s11912-015-0451-3 [doi]
AB  - Tivozanib is a potent and highly specific orally available, tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-1, VEGF 
      receptor-2, and VEGF receptor-3 at very low concentrations with a long half-life 
      (4 days). After its promising activity in xenograft and preclinical models, 
      tivozanib was evaluated in early phase clinical trials in various solid tumors. 
      The phase III trial (TIVO-1) compared tivozanib with sorafenib in metastatic 
      clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Because of detrimental overall survival 
      (OS), Oncology Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) voted against its approval in RCC. 
      Tivozanib is also being evaluated in various other solid tumors like breast, 
      gastrointestinal cancers, hepatocellular cancer, sarcomas, and gynecological 
      cancer. In BATON-CRC trial, low-serum neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) levels were associated 
      with better progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with tivozanib. 
      The NRP-1 will be evaluated as a biomarker for tivozanib response in future 
      clinical trials. Ongoing clinical trial will further characterize activity of 
      tivozanib in hepatocellular carcinoma, sarcomas, and gynecologic cancers.

      Therapeutic Drug Monitoring.
PG  - 814-823
LID - 10.1248/bpb.b21-01098 [doi]
AB  - Oral multi-kinase inhibitors have transformed the treatment landscape for various 
      cancer types and provided significant improvements in clinical outcomes. These 
      agents are mainly approved at fixed doses, but the large inter-individual 
      variability in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (efficacy and safety) has 
      been an unsolved clinical issue. For example, certain patients treated with oral 
      multi-kinase inhibitors at standard doses have severe adverse effects and require 
      dose reduction and discontinuation, yet other patients have a suboptimal response 
      to these drugs. Consequently, optimizing the dosing of oral multi-kinase 
      inhibitors is important to prevent over-dosing or under-dosing. To date, multiple 
      studies on the exposure-efficacy/toxicity relationship of molecular targeted 
      therapy have been attempted for the implementation of therapeutic drug monitoring 
      (TDM) strategies. In this milieu, we recently conducted research on several 
      multi-kinase inhibitors, such as sunitinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, and lenvatinib, 
      with the aim to optimize their treatment efficacy using a 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic approach. Among them, sunitinib use is an example 
      of successful TDM implementation. Sunitinib demonstrated a significant 
      correlation between drug exposure and treatment efficacy or toxicities. As a 
      result, TDM services for sunitinib has been covered by the National Health 
      Insurance program in Japan since April 2018. Additionally, other multi-kinase 
      targeted anticancer drugs have promising data regarding the 
      exposure-efficacy/toxicity relationship, suggesting the possibility of 
      personalization of drug dosage. In this review, we provide a comprehensive 
      summary of the clinical evidence for dose individualization of multi-kinase 
      inhibitors and discuss the utility of TDM of multi-kinase inhibitors, especially 
      sunitinib, pazopanib, sorafenib, and lenvatinib.

TI  - Phase I clinical and pharmacokinetic study of sorafenib in combination with 
      carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
PG  - 844-53
LID - 10.1007/s10637-009-9321-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Unsatisfactory efficacy of current treatments for advanced lung 
      cancer has prompted the search for new therapies, with sorafenib, a multikinase 
      inhibitor, being one candidate drug. This phase I trial was conducted to evaluate 
      drug safety and pharmacokinetics as well as tumor response of sorafenib in 
      combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with advanced non-small 
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Eligible patients received paclitaxel (200 
      mg/m(2)) and carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC]of 6 mg min mL(-1)) on day 1 
      and sorafenib (400 mg, twice daily) on days 2 through 19 of a 21-day cycle. 
      RESULTS: Four of the initial six patients (cohort 1) experienced dose-limiting 
      toxicities (DLTs), resulting in amendment of the treatment protocol. An 
      additional seven patients (cohort 2) were enrolled, two of whom developed DLTs. 
      DLTs included erythema multiforme, hand-foot skin reaction, and elevated plasma 
      alanine aminotransferase in cohort 1 as well as gastrointestinal perforation at a 
      site of metastasis and pneumonia in cohort 2. Most adverse events were 
      manageable. One complete and six partial responses were observed among the 12 
      evaluable patients. Coadministration of the three drugs had no impact on their 
      respective pharmacokinetics. CONCLUSION: The present study confirmed that 
      sorafenib at 400 mg once daily in combination with carboplatin AUC 5 mg min 
      mL(-1) and paclitaxel 200 mg/m(2) is feasible in Japanese patients with advanced 
      NSCLC. The results of this study also showed that this combination therapy had 
      encouraging antitumor activity and was not associated with relevant 
      pharmacokinetic interaction in Japanese NSCLC patients.

TI  - Phase I pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of the multikinase inhibitor 
      sorafenib in combination with clofarabine and cytarabine in pediatric 
      relapsed/refractory leukemia.
PG  - 3293-300
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2011.34.7427 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of 
      multikinase inhibitor sorafenib in combination with clofarabine and cytarabine in 
      children with relapsed/refractory leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients 
      with acute leukemia (11 with acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) received sorafenib on 
      days 1 to 7 and then concurrently with cytarabine (1 g/m(2)) and clofarabine 
      (stratum one: 40 mg/m(2), n = 10; stratum two [recent transplantation or fungal 
      infection]: 20 mg/m(2), n = 2) on days 8 to 12. Sorafenib was continued until day 
      28 if tolerated. Two sorafenib dose levels (200 mg/m(2) and 150 mg/m(2) twice 
      daily) were planned. Sorafenib pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were 
      performed on days 7 and 8. RESULTS: At sorafenib 200 mg/m(2), two of four 
      patients in stratum one and one of two patients in stratum two had grade 3 
      hand-foot skin reaction and/or rash as dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). No DLTs 
      were observed in six patients in stratum one at sorafenib 150 mg/m(2). Sorafenib 
      inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT, S6 ribosomal protein, and 4E-BP1 in 
      leukemia cells. The rate of sorafenib conversion to its metabolite sorafenib 
      N-oxide was high (mean, 33%; range, 17% to 69%). In vitro, the N-oxide potently 
      inhibited FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD; binding constant, 70 nmol/L) and 
      the viability of five AML cell lines. On day 8, sorafenib decreased blast 
      percentages in 10 of 12 patients (median, 66%; range, 9% to 95%). After 
      combination chemotherapy, six patients (three FLT3-ITD and three FLT3 wild-type 
      AML) achieved complete remission, two (both FLT3-ITD AML) had complete remission 
      with incomplete blood count recovery, and one (FLT3 wild-type AML) had partial 
      remission. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib in combination with clofarabine and cytarabine 
      is tolerable and shows activity in relapsed/refractory pediatric AML.

TI  - Phase II study to investigate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of 
      sorafenib in Japanese patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.
PG  - 755-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sorafenib (Nexavar) is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor that targets 
      tumor growth and angiogenesis. This phase II study investigated efficacy, safety, 
      and pharmacokinetics of sorafenib in Japanese patients with advanced renal cell 
      carcinoma (RCC). METHODS: Nonrandomized, open-label study in Japanese patients 
      with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who had received nephrectomy and failed >/=1 
      cytokine-containing therapy. The primary endpoint was response rate. Patients 
      received sorafenib 400 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) on a continuous dosing schedule. 
      RESULTS: A total of 129 patients (median age 63 years) were valid for 
      intention-to-treat analyses. Confirmed partial responses were observed in 16 
      (12.4%) patients, and investigators assessed that 19 (14.7%) of the patients 
      achieved a partial response. Stable disease was reported in 93 (72.1%) patients, 
      and 103 (80.5%) patients had tumor shrinkage. Median progression-free survival 
      was 224 days and the 25th percentile of overall survival was estimated at 288 
      days. The most frequently occurring drug-related adverse events (any grade) were 
      elevated lipase (56%), hand-foot skin reaction (55%), alopecia (39%), increased 
      amylase (38%), rash/desquamation (37%), and diarrhea (34%). A total of 14 (10.7%) 
      patients had serious sorafenib-related adverse events, including one adverse 
      event of worst grade 5 (dyspnea occurred 35 days after the last dose of study 
      medication). The C(trough,steady state) values in RCC patients (n = 63) receiving 
      sorafenib 400 mg b.i.d. were similar to those obtained from a Japanese phase I 
      study involving patients with mixed solid tumors. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib showed 
      encouraging efficacy and was well tolerated in Japanese patients with metastatic 
      RCC.

TI  - Phase IB study of sorafenib in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in 
      patients with refractory solid tumors.
PG  - 333-9
LID - 10.1007/s00280-011-1685-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006), a multikinase inhibitor, has been shown to 
      inhibit tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis by targeting Raf kinase, vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptor, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. 
      This study investigated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of 
      sorafenib in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin. METHODS: Patients with 
      advanced solid tumors were treated with 75 mg/m(2) cisplatin on day 1 and 
      1,250 mg/m(2) gemcitabine on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle. On day 5 of cycle 
      1, sorafenib 400 mg twice daily was started and continued throughout the complete 
      treatment cycles without interruption. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were valid for 
      safety analysis. The most frequent toxicities related to the cytotoxic agents 
      were hematological disorders. Sorafenib-related toxicities were skin-related, 
      gastrointestinal, and constitutional symptoms. No clinically relevant 
      pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between sorafenib, cisplatin, and 
      gemcitabine was detected. AUC(0-72) and C (max) of total and unbound platinum 
      were only marginally changed by concomitant sorafenib. Concomitant sorafenib 
      increased mean AUC and C (max) of gemcitabine by 12 and 21%. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Sorafenib as continuous oral treatment in combination with gemcitabine and 
      cisplatin demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. No clinically relevant 
      pharmacokinetic interaction was detected. Preliminary antitumor activity, 
      pharmacokinetic, and safety data support the recommendation of 400 mg sorafenib 
      twice daily in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine to be further evaluated 
      in clinical studies.

AB  - Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are a novel and target-specific class of 
      anticancer drugs. One drawback of TKI therapy is cancer resistance to TKI. An 
      important TKI resistance mechanism is enhanced efflux of TKI by efflux 
      transporters, such as Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP), in cancer cells. 
      5,7-Dimethoxyflavone (5,7-DMF) is a natural flavonoid which was recently reported 
      to be a potent BCRP inhibitor. In the current study, the effect of 5,7-DMF on the 
      disposition of sorafenib, a TKI which is a good substrate of BCRP, was 
      investigated both in vitro in efflux transporter expressing cells and in vivo in 
      mice. 5,7-DMF significantly inhibited Bcrp1-mediated sorafenib efflux in a 
      concentration dependent manner in MDCK/Bcrp1 cells, with EC(50) value of 8.78 μM. 
      The pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of sorafenib (10 mg/kg) with and 
      without co-administration of 75 mg/kg 5,7-DMF were determined. With 5,7-DMF, the 
      AUC of sorafenib in plasma was 47,400 ± 4790 ng·h/mL, which was significantly 
      higher than 27,300 ± 2650 ng·h/mL in sorafenib alone group. In addition, compared 
      to sorafenib alone group, great increase in sorafenib AUC was observed in most 
      tissues collected when sorafenib was given with 5,7-DMF. Our results indicated 
      that 5,7-DMF may represent a novel and very promising chemosensitizing agent for 
      BCRP-mediated anticancer drug resistance due to its low toxicity and potent BCRP 
      inhibition.

AB  - Membrane receptors with tyrosine kinase activity and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases 
      have emerged as important potential targets in oncology. Starting from basic 
      structures such as anilino-quinazoline, numerous compounds have been synthesised, 
      with the help of tyrosine kinase crystallography, which has allowed to optimise 
      protein-ligand interactions. The catalytic domains of all kinases present similar 
      three-dimensional structures, which explains that it may be difficult to identify 
      molecules having a high specificity for a given tyrosine kinase. Some tyrosine 
      kinase inhibitors are relatively specific for epidermal growth factor receptor 
      (EGFR) such as géfitinib and erlotinib; other are mainly active against 
      platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and the receptor KIT, such as 
      imatinib or nilotinib, and other against vascular endothelial growth factor 
      (VEGF) receptors involved in angiogenesis, such as sunitinib and sorafenib. The 
      oral formulation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors is well accepted by the patients 
      but may generate sometimes compliance problems requiring pharmacokinetic 
      monitoring. This chemical family is in full expansion and several dozens of 
      compounds have entered clinical trials.

TI  - Role of ATP-binding Cassette Transporters in Sorafenib Therapy for Hepatocellular 
      Carcinoma: An Overview.
PG  - 21-32
LID - 10.2174/1389450122666210412125018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Molecular therapy with sorafenib remains the mainstay for 
      advancedstage hepatocellular carcinoma. Notwithstanding, treatment efficacy is 
      low, with few patients obtaining long-lasting benefits due to the high 
      chemoresistance rate. OBJECTIVE: To perform, for the first time, an overview of 
      the literature concerning the role of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette 
      (ABC) transporters in sorafenib therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: 
      Three online databases (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) were searched, from 
      inception to October 2020. Study selection, analysis, and data collection were 
      independently performed by two authors. RESULTS: The search yielded 224 results; 
      29 were selected for inclusion. Most studies were pre-clinical, using HCC cell 
      lines; three used human samples. Studies highlight the effect of sorafenib in 
      decreasing ABC transporters expression. Conversely, it is described the role of 
      ABC transporters, particularly multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR-1), multidrug 
      resistance-associated proteins 1 and 2 (MRP-1 and MRP-2) and ABC subfamily G 
      member 2 (ABCG2) in sorafenib pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, being key 
      resistance factors. Combination therapy with naturally available or synthetic 
      compounds that modulate ABC transporters may revert sorafenib resistance by 
      increasing absorption and intracellular concentration. CONCLUSION: A deeper 
      understanding of ABC transporters' mechanisms may provide guidance for developing 
      innovative approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma. Further studies are warranted 
      to translate the current knowledge into practice and paving the way to 
      individualized therapy.

      with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 1162-1168

AB  - BACKGROUND: This multicentre, open-label, phase-I/randomised phase-II trial 
      evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics, maximum-tolerated-dose (MTD) per 
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and efficacy of nintedanib vs. sorafenib in 
      European patients with unresectable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC). 
      METHODS: Phase I: Patients were stratified into two groups per baseline 
      aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase and Child-Pugh score; MTD was 
      determined. Phase II: Patients were randomised 2:1 to nintedanib (MTD) or 
      sorafenib (400-mg bid) in 28-day cycles until intolerance or disease progression. 
      Time-to-progression (TTP, primary endpoint), overall survival (OS) and 
      progression-free survival (PFS) were determined. RESULTS: Phase-I: no DLTs 
      observed; nintedanib MTD in both groups was 200 mg bid. Phase-II: patients 
      (N = 93) were randomised to nintedanib (n = 62) or sorafenib (n = 31); TTP was 
      5.5 vs. 4.6 months (HR = 1.44 [95% CI, 0.81-2.57]), OS was 11.9 vs. 11.4 months 
      (HR = 0.88 [95% CI, 0.52-1.47]), PFS was 5.3 vs. 3.9 months (HR = 1.35 [95% CI, 
      0.78-2.34]), respectively (all medians). Dose intensity and tolerability favoured 
      nintedanib. Fewer patients on nintedanib (87.1%) vs. sorafenib (96.8%) had 
      drug-related adverse events (AEs) or grade ≥ 3 AEs (67.7% vs. 90.3%), but more 
      patients on nintedanib (28 [45.2%]) had AEs leading to drug discontinuation than 
      did those on sorafenib (7 [22.6%]). CONCLUSIONS: Nintedanib may have similar 
      efficacy to sorafenib in aHCC.

PG  - 4849-57
AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib and erlotinib are potent, orally administered receptor 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors with antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activities. 
      Given their inhibitory target profile and efficacy as single agents, the 
      combination of these drugs is of considerable interest in solid malignancies. 
      This study aimed to determine the recommended phase II dose of this targeted 
      combination, their toxicity profile, pharmacokinetic interaction, and preliminary 
      clinical activities. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Sorafenib was administered alone for a 
      1-week run-in period, and then both drugs were given together continuously, with 
      every 28 days considered as a cycle. Three dose levels were assessed. RESULTS: 
      Seventeen patients with advanced solid tumors received 75 cycles of treatment. 
      The most frequent adverse events of all grades were constitutional and 
      gastrointestinal in nature followed by electrolytes and dermatologic toxicities. 
      Fatigue was the most common adverse event (17 patients; 100%) followed by 
      diarrhea (15 patients; 88%), hypophosphatemia (13 patients; 76%), and acneiform 
      rash (12 patients; 71%). These adverse events were predominantly mild to 
      moderate. The recommended phase II dose of this combination was determined as 400 
      mg twice daily sorafenib and 150 mg daily erlotinib. Pharmacokinetic analysis 
      revealed no significant effect of erlotinib on the pharmacokinetic profile of 
      sorafenib. Among 15 evaluable patients, 3 (20%) achieved a confirmed partial 
      response and 9 (60%) had stable disease as best response. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib 
      and erlotinib are well tolerated and seem to have no pharmacokinetic interactions 
      when administered in combination at their full single-agent recommended doses. 
      This well tolerated combination resulted in promising activity that needs further 
      validation in phase II studies.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of tyrosine kinase inhibitors: focus on pyrimidines, 
      pyridines and pyrroles.
PG  - 551-603
LID - 10.2165/11593320-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - Pyrimidine (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and pazopanib), pyridine (sorafenib) 
      and pyrrole (sunitinib) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are multi-targeted TKIs 
      with high activity towards several families of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine 
      kinases involved in angiogenesis, tumour growth and metastatic progression of 
      cancer. These orally administered TKIs have quite diverse characteristics with 
      regard to absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Absolute bioavailability in 
      humans has been investigated only for imatinib (almost 100%) and pazopanib 
      (14-39%; n = 3). On the basis of human radioactivity data, dasatinib is 
      considered to be well absorbed after oral administration (19% and 0.1% of the 
      total radioactivity were excreted as unchanged dasatinib in the faeces and urine, 
      respectively). Quite low absolute bioavailability under fasted conditions is 
      assumed for nilotinib (31%), sorafenib (50%) and sunitinib (50%). Imatinib, 
      dasatinib and sunitinib exhibit dose-proportional increases in their area under 
      the plasma concentration-time curve values over their therapeutic dose ranges. 
      Less than dose-proportional increases were observed for nilotinib at doses 
      ≥400 mg/day and for sorafenib and pazopanib at doses ≥800 mg/day. At steady 
      state, the accumulation ratios are 1.5-2.5 (unchanged imatinib), 2.0 (nilotinib 
      once-daily dosing), 3.4 (nilotinib twice-daily dosing), 1.2-4.5 (pazopanib), 
      5.7-6.4 (sorafenib) and 3.0-4.5 (sunitinib). Concomitant intake of a high-fat 
      meal does not alter exposure to imatinib, dasatinib and sunitinib but leads to 
      considerably increased bioavailability of nilotinib and pazopanib and decreased 
      bioavailability of sorafenib. With the exception of pazopanib, the TKIs described 
      here have large apparent volumes of distribution, exceeding the volume of body 
      water by at least 4-fold. Very low penetration into the central nervous system in 
      humans has been reported for imatinib and dasatinib, but there are currently no 
      published human data for nilotinib, pazopanib, sorafenib or sunitinib. All TKIs 
      that have been described are more than 90% bound to the plasma proteins: 
      α(1)-acid glycoprotein and/or albumin. They are metabolized primarily via 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, the only exception being sorafenib, for which uridine 
      diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 is the other main enzyme involved. Active 
      metabolites of imatinib and sunitinib contribute to their antitumour activity. 
      Although some patient demographics have been identified as significant co-factors 
      that partly explain interindividual variability in exposure to TKIs, these 
      findings have not been regarded as sufficient to recommend age-, sex-, 
      bodyweight- or ethnicity-specific dose adjustment. Systemic exposure to imatinib, 
      sorafenib and pazopanib increases in patients with hepatic impairment, and 
      reduction of the initial therapeutic dose is recommended in this subpopulation. 
      The starting dose of imatinib should also be reduced in renally impaired 
      subjects. Because the solubility of dasatinib is pH dependent, co-administration 
      of histamine H(2)-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors with dasatinib 
      should be avoided. With the exception of sorafenib, systemic exposure to TKIs is 
      significantly decreased/increased by co-administration of potent CYP3A4 
      inducers/inhibitors, and so it is strongly recommended that the TKI dose is 
      adjusted or that such co-administration is avoided. Caution is also recommended 
      for co-administration of CYP3A4 substrates with TKIs, especially for those with a 
      narrow therapeutic index. However, current recommendations with regard to dose 
      adjustment of TKIs need to be validated in clinical studies. Further 
      investigations are needed to explain the large interindividual variability in the 
      pharmacokinetics of these drugs and to assess theclinical relevance of their 
      interaction potential and inhibitory effects on metabolizing enzymes and 
      transporters.

AB  - PURPOSE: To define the safety, efficacy, and pharmacogenetic and pharmacodynamic 
      effects of sorafenib with gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in locally 
      advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients received gemcitabine 
      1000 mg/m(2) intravenously weekly × 3 every 4 weeks per cycle for 1 cycle before 
      CRT and continued for up to 4 cycles after CRT. Weekly gemcitabine 600 mg/m(2) 
      intravenously was given during concurrent intensity modulated radiation therapy 
      of 50 Gy to gross tumor volume in 25 fractions. Sorafenib was dosed orally 400 mg 
      twice daily until progression, except during CRT when it was escalated from 200 
      mg to 400 mg daily, and 400 mg twice daily. The maximum tolerated dose cohort was 
      expanded to 15 patients. Correlative studies included dynamic contrast-enhanced 
      MRI and angiogenesis genes polymorphisms (VEGF-A and VEGF-R2 single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms). RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled. No dose-limiting 
      toxicity occurred during induction gemcitabine/sorafenib followed by concurrent 
      CRT. The most common grade 3/4 toxicities were fatigue, hematologic, and 
      gastrointestinal. The maximum tolerated dose was sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. 
      The median progression-free survival and overall survival for 25 evaluable 
      patients were 10.6 and 12.6 months, respectively. The median overall survival for 
      patients with VEGF-A -2578 AA, -1498 CC, and -1154 AA versus alternate genotypes 
      was 21.6 versus 14.7 months. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI demonstrated higher 
      baseline K(trans) in responding patients. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent sorafenib with 
      CRT had modest clinical activity with increased gastrointestinal toxicity in 
      localized unresectable pancreatic cancer. Select VEGF-A/VEGF-R2 genotypes were 
      associated with favorable survival.

TI  - A phase I trial and pharmacokinetic study of sorafenib in children with 
      refractory solid tumors or leukemias: a Children's Oncology Group Phase I 
      Consortium report.
PG  - 6011-22
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-3284 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), maximum tolerated dose 
      (MTD), pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of sorafenib in children with 
      refractory extracranial solid tumors and evaluate the tolerability of the solid 
      tumor MTD in children with refractory leukemias. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Sorafenib 
      was administered orally every 12 hours for consecutive 28-day cycles. 
      Pharmacokinetics (day 1 and steady-state) and pharmacodynamics were conducted 
      during cycle 1. RESULTS: Of 65 patients enrolled, 60 were eligible. In the solid 
      tumor cohort (n = 49), 4 of 6 patients experienced a DLT [hypertension, pain, 
      rash/urticaria, thrombocytopenia, alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate 
      aminotransferase (AST)] at the starting dose (150 mg/m(2)/dose) which resulted in 
      de-escalation to 105 mg/m(2)/dose. After eligibility criteria modification and 
      dose re-escalation, the MTD was 200 mg/m(2)/dose for solid tumors and 150 
      mg/m(2)/dose for leukemias. Sorafenib exposure was highly variable between 
      patients but was within the ranges reported in adults. The apparent sorafenib 
      clearance increased with patient age. Diarrhea, rash, fatigue, and increased 
      ALT/AST were the most common sorafenib-related toxicities. Stable disease for 4 
      or more cycles was observed in 14 solid tumor patients, and 2 patients with acute 
      myeloid leukemia (AML) and FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3ITD) experienced 
      a decrease in bone marrow blasts to less than 5%. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended 
      phase II dose of sorafenib administered every 12 hours continuously for children 
      with solid tumors is 200 mg/m(2)/dose and 150 mg/m(2)/dose for children with 
      leukemias. Sorafenib toxicities and distribution in children are similar to 
      adults. The activity of sorafenib in children with AML and FLT3ITD is currently 
      being evaluated, and a phase II study for select solid tumors is ongoing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ERBB2 (HER2) pathways 
      and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent angiogenesis have a 
      pivotal role in cancer pathogenesis and progression. Robust experimental evidence 
      has shown that these pathways are functionally linked and implicated in acquired 
      resistance to targeted therapies making them attractive candidates for joined 
      targeting. We undertook this phase I trial to assess the safety, the recommended 
      dose for phase II trials (RPTD), pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), 
      and the preliminary antitumour activity of the combination of lapatinib and 
      sorafenib in patients with advanced refractory solid tumours. METHODS: Four 
      cohorts of at least three patients each received lapatinib once daily and 
      sorafenib twice daily together on a continuous schedule. Doses of lapatinib and 
      sorafenib were escalated based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the first 
      treatment cycle following a traditional 3+3 design until the RPTD was reached. 
      Additional patients were treated at the RPTD to characterise PK profiles of this 
      combination and to investigate the potential interaction between lapatinib and 
      sorafenib. Serum samples were collected at baseline and then prospectively every 
      two cycles to assess changes in PD parameters. This trial is registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00984425. FINDINGS: Thirty patients with advanced 
      refractory solid tumours were enroled. DLTs were grade three fatigue and grade 3 
      atypical skin rash observed at dose levels 3 and 4, respectively. The higher dose 
      level explored (lapatinib 1250mg/day and sorafenib 400mg twice daily) represented 
      the RPTD of the combination. The most common drug-related adverse events were 
      fatigue (68%), hypocalcemia (61%), diarrhoea (57%), lymphopaenia (54%), anorexia 
      (50%), rash (50%), and hypophosphatemia (46%). PK analysis revealed no 
      significant effect of sorafenib on the PK profile of lapatinib. Of the 27 
      assessable patients for clinical activity, one achieved a confirmed complete 
      response, four (15%) had a partial response, and 12 (44%) achieved disease 
      stabilisation. The disease control rate overall was 63%. INTERPRETATION: 
      Combination treatment with lapatinib and sorafenib was feasible with promising 
      clinical activity and without significant PK interactions. Long term tolerability 
      seems to be challenging.

AB  - VEGF blockade does not uniformly result in clinical benefit. We evaluated safety, 
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), recommended phase II dose (RP2D), antitumor 
      efficacy, and exploratory biomarkers including pharmacogenomics and 
      pharmacokinetics with sorafenib, bevacizumab, and paclitaxel in patients with 
      refractory cancers. The study had a "3 + 3" design, using paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) 
      every week for 3 weeks, in every 4 week cycles, bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 2 
      weeks, and sorafenib 200 or 400 mg twice a day, 5 or 7 days/week (5/7, 7/7). The 
      MTD cohort was expanded. Twenty-seven patients enrolled in 3 cohorts: sorafenib 
      200 mg twice a day 5/7, 200 mg twice a day 7/7, and 400 mg twice a day 5/7. DLTs 
      were grade 3 neutropenia >7 days (cohort 1, 1), grade 3 hypertension (cohort 2, 
      1), grade 3 hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR; cohort 3, 2). MTD was sorafenib 200 mg 
      twice a day 7/7. Six DLTs occurred in cohort 2 expansion: grade 3 HFSR (2), grade 
      2 HFSR with sorafenib delay >7 days (2), grade 4 cerebrovascular accident (1), 
      grade 3 neutropenia >7 days (1). RP2D was sorafenib 200 mg twice a day 5/7. Most 
      patients (62%) dose reduced sorafenib to 200 mg daily 5/7 after a median 3 
      (range, 2-17) cycles. Response rates were 48% overall (27) and 64% for ovarian 
      cancers (14). VEGF-A-1154AA and -7TT recessive homozygous genotypes conferred 
      worse overall survival versus alternative genotypes (7 vs. 22 months). 
      Intermittent, low-dose sorafenib (200 mg twice a day 5/7) combined with 
      bevacizumab and paclitaxel was tolerable and had high antitumor efficacy in 
      patients with refractory cancer (NCT00572078).

      study.
PG  - 43458-43469
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.16465 [doi]
AB  - This single-center, observational study analyzed the association between plasma 
      concentration of sorafenib and its safety and efficacy in Chinese patients with 
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Adult patients with RCC (n = 94), treated 
      with sorafenib were enrolled between January 2014 and January 2015. Sorafenib 
      plasma concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry. Safety and efficacy variables were evaluated using National Cancer 
      Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events and Response Evaluation 
      Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria. Association of plasma concentration with 
      safety and efficacy was analyzed. The steady state plasma concentration of 
      sorafenib after 2 weeks of treatment ranged from 881 to 12,526 ng/mL. Major 
      adverse reactions (ADRs) included diarrhea (76.5%), hand-foot syndrome (HFS; 
      68.99%) and fatigue (55.32%). Significant association was reported between plasma 
      concentration and all the ADRs except rash. At 6 weeks, complete response (CR), 
      partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) was 
      reported in 3.1%, 13.82%, 52.2% and 13.82% patients, respectively. Objective 
      response and disease control rates were 17.02% and 69.14%. Plasma concentration 
      of sorafenib was >10,000 ng/mL in patients with severe ADRs, which decreased with 
      reduction in dose or discontinuation of treatment. After 21.2 weeks follow-up, 
      median progression free survival was 12.3 months. CR, PR, SD and PD were reported 
      in 1%, 46%, 33% and 19% patients. In conclusion, plasma concentration of 
      sorafenib was associated with its safety and efficacy in Chinese patients with 
      mRCC.

TI  - Early sorafenib-induced toxicity is associated with drug exposure and UGTIA9 
      genetic polymorphism in patients with solid tumors: a preliminary study.
PG  - e42875
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0042875 [doi]
LID - e42875
AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying predictive biomarkers of drug response is of key 
      importance to improve therapy management and drug selection in cancer therapy. To 
      date, the influence of drug exposure and pharmacogenetic variants on 
      sorafenib-induced toxicity remains poorly documented. The aim of this 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) study was to investigate the relationship 
      between early toxicity and drug exposure or pharmacogenetic variants in 
      unselected adult outpatients treated with single-agent sorafenib for advanced 
      solid tumors. METHODS: Toxicity was recorded in 54 patients on days 15 and 30 
      after treatment initiation and sorafenib exposure was assessed in 51 patients. 
      The influence of polymorphisms in CYP3A5, UGT1A9, ABCB1 and ABCG2 was examined in 
      relation to sorafenib exposure and toxicity. Clinical characteristics, drug 
      exposure and pharmacogenetic variants were tested univariately for association 
      with toxicities. Candidate variables with p<0.1 were analyzed in a multivariate 
      analysis. RESULTS: Gender was the sole parameter independently associated with 
      sorafenib exposure (p = 0.0008). Multivariate analysis showed that increased 
      cumulated sorafenib (AUC(cum)) was independently associated with any grade ≥ 3 
      toxicity (p = 0.037); UGT1A9 polymorphism (rs17868320) with grade ≥ 2 diarrhea (p 
      = 0.015) and female gender with grade ≥ 2 hand-foot skin reaction (p = 0.018). 
      Using ROC curve, the threshold AUC(cum) value of 3,161 mg/L.h was associated with 
      the highest risk to develop any grade ≥ 3 toxicity (p = 0.018). CONCLUSION: In 
      this preliminary study, increased cumulated drug exposure and UGT1A9 polymorphism 
      (rs17868320) identified patients at high risk for early sorafenib-induced severe 
      toxicity. Further PK/PD studies on larger population are warranted to confirm 
      these preliminary results.

TI  - Herbacetin Broadly Blocks the Activities of CYP450s by Different Inhibitory 
      Mechanisms.
PG  - 507-517
LID - 10.1055/a-1502-7131 [doi]
AB  - Herbacetin is a bioactive flavanol compound that has various pharmacological 
      effects. However, the pharmacokinetic characteristics have not been thoroughly 
      investigated. Previously, we screened a natural compound library and identified 
      herbacetin as a potent CYP blocker. Herein, we aimed to mechanistically determine 
      the inhibitory effects of herbacetin on CYP450 and its potential application. A 
      human liver microsome incubation system was developed based on a UPLC-MS/MS 
      method. Moreover, an in silico docking assay and a human CYP recombinase reaction 
      system were developed and used to investigate binding affinity and inhibitory 
      efficacy. Subsequently, the effects of the combination of herbacetin and 
      sorafenib on HepG2 cells were assessed by MTT and immunoblotting assays. The 
      concentration of sorafenib and its main metabolite were measured by UPLC-MS/MS 
      after incubation with or without herbacetin. As a result, we found herbacetin 
      almost completely inhibited the functions of major CYPs at 100 µM. Moreover, 
      through analysis of the structure-activity relationship, we found 4-, 6-, and 
      8-hydroxyl were essential groups for the inhibitory effects. Herbacetin inhibited 
      CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2E1 in a mixed manner, but non-competitively 
      blocked CYP2D6. These results are in good agreement with the recombinase reaction 
      in vitro results, with an IC(50) < 10 µM for each tested isoenzyme. 
      Interestingly, the stimulatory effects of sorafenib on HepG2 cell apoptosis were 
      significantly enhanced by combining with herbacetin, which was associated with 
      increased sorafenib exposure. In summary, herbacetin is a potent inhibitor of a 
      wide spectrum of CYP450s, which may enhance the exposure of drugs in vivo.

TI  - Correlation between clinical response to sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma 
      treatment and polymorphisms of P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and of breast cancer 
      resistance protein (ABCG2): monocentric study.
PG  - 759-766
LID - 10.1007/s00280-017-3268-y [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We studied the relation between the polymorphism of P-glycoprotein 
      (P-gp) and of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), encoded by ABCB1 and ABCG2 
      genes, respectively, and the pharmacokinetic variability and clinical response 
      during the treatment with sorafenib of hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: At the 
      Paul Brousse Hospital in Villejuif, France, 47 consecutive patients with advanced 
      HCC treated with a single agent sorafenib, were enrolled. Sorafenib exposure was 
      measured by its plasma concentration 3 h after oral administration of 400 mg 
      (bid) by liquid chromatography. All enrolled patients were genotyped for ABCB1 
      (rs2032582; rs1045642) and ABCG2 (rs2231137; rs2231142; rs2622604) by blood 
      genomic DNA extraction and Mass ARRAY genotyping. The clinical response was 
      evaluated after 3months of treatment according to the RECIST criteria. KEY 
      FINDINGS: Significant associations between sorafenib exposure and the studied 
      polymorphisms were observed for ABCB1 3435C>T, ABCG2 34G>A, ABCG2 1143C>T and 
      ABCG2 421C>A, but not for ABCB1 2677G>TA SNP. In heterozygous patients for ABCB1 
      3435 C>T, ABCG2 34 G>A and ABCG2 1143 C>T polymorphisms were significantly 
      associated with the lowest sorafenib plasma levels. Those patients presented a 
      tendency to have the best clinical evolution. CONCLUSION: Heterozygous forms of 
      the studied polymorphisms could be associated with a better therapeutic response.

TI  - Resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma to sorafenib can be overcome with 
      co-delivery of PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 and sorafenib in nanoparticles.
PG  - 573-587
LID - 10.1080/17425247.2020.1730809 [doi]
AB  - Background: The combination of BEZ235 with sorafenib (SFB) enhances 
      anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) efficacy of the two agents. However, 
      pharmacokinetic profiles in vivo and different endocytosis abilities of these two 
      drugs hinder their therapeutic application.Research design and methods: In this 
      work, we developed d-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate - 
      polycaprolactone polymer nanoparticles (NPs) for co-delivery of SFB and BEZ235 
      (SFB/BEZ235-NPs). Explored the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of 
      SFB/BEZ235-NPs through in vitro and in vivo experiments.Results: Stabilized 
      SFB/BEZ235-NPs were prepared with optimized drug ratio, yielding high 
      encapsulation efficiency, low polydispersity, and enhanced cellular 
      internalization in HepG2 cells. Synergistic cytotoxicity and pro-apoptotic 
      ability were documented. In vivo pharmacokinetic results revealed extended 
      circulation and bioavailability of SFB/BEZ235-NPs compared with those of free 
      drugs. SFB/BEZ235-NPs enhanced antitumor effectiveness in SFB-resistant HCC 
      xenograft mouse models.Conclusion: Taken together, the results of this study 
      describe a promising strategy using SFB and BEZ235 in a nanoparticle formulation 
      for treatment of SFB-resistant HCC.

TI  - Hand-foot skin reaction increases with cumulative sorafenib dose and with 
      combination anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy.
PG  - 1411-6
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1141 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 and 
      RAF kinase inhibitor, commonly causes skin toxicity. We retrospectively analyzed 
      dermatologic toxicity in patients receiving combined antiangiogenic therapy 
      involving sorafenib and bevacizumab. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Castration-resistant 
      prostate cancer and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients were accrued 
      to phase II studies, receiving sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. A phase I study 
      explored sorafenib 200 to 400 mg twice daily with bevacizumab 5 to 10 mg/kg every 
      2 weeks in patients with advanced solid tumors. The probability of development of 
      maximum grade of dermatologic toxicity as a function of the cumulative dose of 
      sorafenib was determined. Additional analyses compared extent of toxicity, 
      pharmacokinetics, and patient risk factors. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients were 
      enrolled: 54 received sorafenib and 42 received bevacizumab/sorafenib. Hand-foot 
      skin reaction (HFSR) was observed in 50 of 96 (52%) patients. Grade 2 to 3 HFSR 
      developed in 16 of 54 (30%) sorafenib patients and 24 of 42 (57%) 
      bevacizumab/sorafenib patients (P=0.012) and was associated with cumulative 
      sorafenib exposure (P=0.0008). Twenty-four of 42 phase I patients randomized to 
      start with bevacizumab had increased risk of grade 2 to 3 HFSR than those 
      starting with sorafenib (P=0.013) after adjusting for association between HFSR 
      risk and hypertension (P=0.01), which was the only toxicity associated with HFSR. 
      There was no association between HFSR and baseline history of neuropathy, prior 
      taxane/platinum treatment, or systemic sorafenib levels. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Sorafenib-related HFSR is associated with increasing cumulative sorafenib dose. 
      HFSR is increased in patients treated with bevacizumab/sorafenib combination 
      anti-VEGF therapy, and this finding is not explained by pharmacokinetic 
      interaction between the two agents. Our results suggest that the pathophysiology 
      of HFSR may be related to VEGF inhibition.

TI  - Phase I combination of sorafenib and erlotinib therapy in solid tumors: safety, 
      pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic evaluation from an expansion cohort.
PG  - 751-60
LID - 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0868 [doi]
AB  - The aims of this study were to further define the safety of sorafenib and 
      erlotinib, given at their full approved monotherapy doses, and to correlate 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic markers with clinical outcome. In addition, a 
      novel pharmacodynamic marker based on the real-time measurement of RAF signal 
      transduction capacity (STC) is described. Sorafenib was administered alone for a 
      1-week run-in period, and then both drugs were given together continuously. RAF 
      STC was assessed in peripheral blood monocytes prior to erlotinib initiation. 
      Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and K-RAS mutations were 
      measured in archival tumor samples. Changes in pERK and CD31 were determined in 
      fresh tumor biopsies obtained pretreatment, prior to erlotinib dosing, and during 
      the administration of both drugs. In addition, positron emission 
      tomography-computed tomography scans and pharmacokinetic assessments were done. 
      Eleven patients received a total of 57 cycles (median, 5; range, 1-10). Only four 
      patients received full doses of both drugs for the entire study course, with 
      elevation of liver enzymes being the main reason for dose reductions and delays. 
      Among 10 patients evaluable for response, 8 experienced tumor stabilization of 
      >or=4 cycles. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no significant interaction of 
      erlotinib with sorafenib. Sorafenib-induced decrease in RAF-STC showed 
      statistically significant correlation with time-to-progression in seven patients. 
      Other pharmacodynamic markers did not correlate with clinical outcome. This drug 
      combination resulted in promising clinical activity in solid tumor patients 
      although significant toxicity warrants close monitoring. RAF-STC deserves further 
      study as a predictive marker for sorafenib.

TI  - Phase I trial and pharmacokinetic study of sorafenib in children with 
      neurofibromatosis type I and plexiform neurofibromas.
PG  - 396-401
LID - 10.1002/pbc.24281 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib targets multiple pathways thought to be crucial in growth 
      of plexiform neurofibroma (PN) in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). 
      Sorafenib has been tolerated with manageable toxicities in adults and children 
      with refractory cancer. We conducted a separate study in this population. 
      Monitoring long-term toxicities such as effects on growth and obtaining 
      additional pharmacokinetic data were of importance due to the young age and long 
      duration of therapy seen in previous phase I trials in children with NF1. 
      PROCEDURE: Children ≥3 and ≤18-year-old with NF1 and inoperable PN were eligible. 
      Sorafenib was administered orally twice daily for consecutive 28-day cycles. 
      Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined from toxicities observed during the 
      first three cycles. RESULTS: Nine children enrolled, median age 8 (6-12) years. 
      At the starting 115 mg/m(2) /dose (n = 5), two experienced dose-limiting grade 3 
      pain in their PN. At the de-escalated 80 mg/m(2) /dose (n = 4), approximately 40% 
      of the pediatric solid tumor MTD, two had dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 rash 
      and grade 4 mood alteration), exceeding the MTD. At 80 mg/m(2) /dose, the median 
      AUC(0-12 hours) at steady-state was 39.5 µg hours/ml. Toxicities appeared to 
      correspond with decreases in quality of life (QOL). No tumor shrinkage was 
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: Children with NF1 and PN did not tolerate sorafenib at 
      doses substantially lower than the MTD in children and adults with malignant 
      solid tumors. Future trials with targeted agents for children with NF1 may 
      require a more conservative starting dose and separate definitions of dose 
      limiting toxicities (DLT) than children with cancer.

TI  - Co-delivery of Sorafenib and CRISPR/Cas9 Based on Targeted Core-Shell Hollow 
      Mesoporous Organosilica Nanoparticles for Synergistic HCC Therapy.
PG  - 57362-57372
LID - 10.1021/acsami.0c17660 [doi]
AB  - The rapid development of CRISPR/Cas9 systems has opened up tantalizing prospects 
      to sensitize cancers to chemotherapy using efficient targeted genome editing, but 
      safety concerns and possible off-target effects of viral vectors remain a major 
      obstacle for clinical application. Thus, the construction of novel nonviral 
      tumor-targeting nanodelivery systems has great potential for the safe application 
      of CRISPR/Cas9 systems for gene-chemo-combination therapy. Here, we report a 
      polyamidoamine-aptamer-coated hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticle for the 
      co-delivery of sorafenib and CRISPR/Cas9. The core-shell nanoparticles had good 
      stability, enabled ultrahigh drug loading, targeted delivery, and 
      controlled-release of the gene-drug combination. The nanocomplex showed >60% 
      EGFR-editing efficiency without off-target effects in all nine similar sites, 
      regulating the EGFR-PI3K-Akt pathway to inhibit angiogenesis, and exhibited a 
      synergistic effect on cell proliferation. Importantly, the co-delivery nanosystem 
      achieved efficient EGFR gene therapy and caused 85% tumor inhibition in a mouse 
      model. Furthermore, the nanocomplex showed high accumulation at the tumor site in 
      vivo and exhibited good safety with no damage to major organs. Due to these 
      properties, the nanocomplex provides a versatile delivery approach for efficient 
      co-loading of gene-drug combinations, allowing for precise gene editing and 
      synergistic inhibition of tumor growth without apparent side effects on normal 
      tissues.

TI  - Assessment of nutritional status in cancer--the relationship between body 
      composition and pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 1197-203
AB  - Several nutritional assessment tools have been used in oncology settings to 
      monitor nutritional status and its associated prognostic significance. Body 
      composition is fundamental for the assessment of nutritional status. Recently, 
      the use of accurate and precise body composition tools has significantly added to 
      the value of nutritional assessment in this clinical setting. Computerized 
      tomography (CT) is an example of a technique which provides state-of-the-art 
      assessment of body composition. With use of CT images, a great variability in 
      body composition of cancer patients has been identified even in people with 
      identical body weight or body mass index. Severe muscle depletion (sarcopenia) 
      has emerged as a prevalent body composition phenotype which is predictive of poor 
      functional status, shorter time to tumor progression, shorter survival, and 
      higher incidence of dose-limiting toxicity. Variability in body composition of 
      cancer patients may be a source of disparities in the metabolism of cytotoxic 
      agents. Future clinical trials investigating dose reductions in patients with 
      sarcopenia and dose-escalating studies based on pre-treatment body composition 
      assessment have the potential to alter cancer treatment paradigms.

TI  - Exposure-Response Modeling and Simulation of Progression-Free Survival and 
      Adverse Events of Sorafenib Treatment in Patients With Advanced Thyroid Cancer.
PG  - 459-469
LID - 10.1111/cts.12634 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of 
      differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC), renal cell carcinoma, and hepatocellular 
      carcinoma. In the phase III DECISION trial in patients with DTC, sorafenib 
      exposure and the incidence of some adverse events (AEs) were higher than in 
      previous trials; therefore, we analyzed exposure-response relationships, 
      including progression-free survival (PFS) and selected AEs in patients with DTC. 
      A novel, stratified prediction-corrected visual predictive check (pc-VPC) was 
      developed to show robustness of the exposure-response relationships. 
      Time-to-event simulations confirmed the benefit of the recommended dosing 
      schedule of 800 mg/day: initial doses of 800 mg/day were associated with the 
      highest PFS, whereas lower doses (600 or 400 mg/day) were associated with 
      improved tolerability but reduced PFS. A simulated dose-reduction strategy of 
      800 mg/day for an initial two cycles followed by dose reductions seemed likely to 
      maintain efficacy while possibly mitigating selected AEs (e.g., diarrhea and 
      hand-foot skin reactions).

TI  - Advancing treatment of acute myeloid leukemia: the future of FLT3 inhibitors.
PG  - 273-286
LID - 10.1080/14737140.2019.1573679 [doi]
AB  - Mutations of the FLT3 gene are among most common genetic abnormalities occurring 
      in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with dismal prognosis. 
      Tremendous effort has been devoted to developing clinically effective FLT3 
      inhibitors. First generation inhibitors consisted of multi-kinase inhibitors 
      (sorafenib, lestaurtinib, midostaurin), which blocked FLT3 as well as multiple 
      other kinase receptors. The failure of these agents to induce durable responses 
      led to the development of second generation FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
      (quizartinib, crenolinib, gilteritinib) exhibiting high potency and specificity 
      for mutant FLT3 kinases and sustained in vivo FLT3 inhibition. These myriad FLT3 
      inhibitors possess diverse kinase inhibitory properties, toxicity profiles, and 
      pharmacokinetics, which impact on their incorporation into therapeutic regimens. 
      Areas covered: This article reviews the medical literature on current and future 
      FLT3 inhibitors for AML therapy. We provide algorithms for which kinase inhibitor 
      should be utilized for different FLT3 mutations (ITD±TKD) and clinical scenarios 
      (de novo, relapsed/refractory, fit vs. unfit) and discuss novel FLT3 targeted 
      therapeutic approaches. Expert commentary: Integration of clinically active FLT3 
      inhibitors into all stages of therapy for all individuals with FLT3 mutant AML 
      promises to significantly improve outcomes for this poor prognosis disease.

TI  - A rapid and sensitive method for determination of sorafenib in human plasma using 
      a liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry assay.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - A rapid, sensitive and specific method was developed and validated using LC/MS/MS 
      for determination of sorafenib in human plasma. Sample preparation involved a 
      single protein precipitation step by the addition of 0.1 mL of plasma with 0.5 mL 
      acetonitrile. Analysis of the compounds of interest including the internal 
      standard ([(2)H(3)(15)N] sorafenib) was achieved on a Waters X-Terra C(18) (150 
      mm x 2.1mm i.d., 3.5 microm) analytical column using a mobile phase consisting of 
      acetonitrile/10 mM ammonium acetate (65:35, v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid and 
      isocratic flow at 0.2 mL/min for 6 min. The analytes were monitored by tandem 
      mass spectrometry with electrospray positive ionization. Linear calibration 
      curves were generated over the range of 7.3-7260 ng/mL for the human plasma 
      samples with values for the coefficient of determination of >0.96. The values for 
      both within day and between day precision and accuracy were well within the 
      generally accepted criteria for analytical methods (<15%).

TI  - A phase I trial of the oral, multikinase inhibitor sorafenib in combination with 
      carboplatin and paclitaxel.
PG  - 4836-42
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4123 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study evaluated the safety, maximum tolerated dose, 
      pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, 
      combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with solid tumors. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with advanced cancer (24 with melanoma) 
      received oral sorafenib 100, 200, or 400 mg twice daily on days 2 to 19 of a 
      21-day cycle. All patients received carboplatin corresponding to AUC6 and 225 
      mg/m(2) paclitaxel on day 1. Pharmacokinetic analyses were done for sorafenib on 
      days 2 and 19 of cycle 1 and for paclitaxel on day 1 of cycles 1 and 2. 
      Pretreatment tumor samples from 17 melanoma patients were analyzed for BRAF 
      mutations. RESULTS: Sorafenib was well tolerated at the doses evaluated. The most 
      frequent severe adverse events were hematologic toxicities (grade 3 or 4 in 33 
      patients, 85%). Twenty-seven (69%) patients had sorafenib-related adverse events, 
      the most frequent of which were dermatologic events (26 patients, 67%). Exposure 
      to paclitaxel was not altered by intervening treatment with sorafenib. Treatment 
      with sorafenib, paclitaxel, and carboplatin resulted in one complete response and 
      nine partial responses, all among patients with melanoma. There was no 
      correlation between BRAF mutational status and treatment responses in patients 
      with melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended phase II doses are oral 400 mg twice 
      daily sorafenib, carboplatin at an AUC6 dose, and 225 mg/m(2) paclitaxel. The 
      tumor responses observed with this combined regimen in patients with melanoma 
      warrant further investigation.

TI  - A Phase 2 Study of Galunisertib (TGF-β1 Receptor Type I Inhibitor) and Sorafenib 
      in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - e00056
LID - 10.14309/ctg.0000000000000056 [doi]
LID - e00056
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Inhibition of tumor growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor type I 
      potentiated the activity of sorafenib in preclinical models of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). Galunisertib is a small-molecule selective inhibitor of TGF-β1 
      receptor type I, which demonstrated activity in a phase 2 trial as second-line 
      HCC treatment. METHODS: The combination of galunisertib and sorafenib (400 mg 
      BID) was tested in patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh A liver function 
      without prior systemic therapy. Galunisertib dose was administered 80 or 150 mg 
      b.i.d. orally for 14 days every 28 days in safety lead-in cohorts; in the 
      expansion cohort, all patients received galunisertib 150 mg b.i.d. Objectives 
      included time-to-tumor progression, changes in circulating alpha fetoprotein and 
      TGF-β1, safety, overall survival (OS), response rate, and pharmacokinetics (PK). 
      RESULTS: Patients (n = 47) were enrolled from 5 non-Asian countries; 3 and 44 
      patients received the 80 mg and 150 mg b.i.d. doses of galunisertib, 
      respectively. The pharmacokinetics and safety profiles were consistent with 
      monotherapy of each drug. For the 150 mg b.i.d. galunisertib cohort, the median 
      time-to-tumor progression was 4.1 months; the median OS was 18.8 months. A 
      partial response was seen in 2 patients, stable disease in 21, and progressive 
      disease in 13. TGF-β1 responders (decrease of >20% from baseline) vs 
      nonresponders had longer OS (22.8 vs 12.0 months, P = 0.038). DISCUSSION: The 
      combination of galunisertib and sorafenib showed acceptable safety and a 
      prolonged OS outcome.

TI  - Phase I trial of sorafenib and gemcitabine in advanced solid tumors with an 
      expanded cohort in advanced pancreatic cancer.
PG  - 144-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: With its potent inhibitory effects against Raf-1 kinase and vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptor-2, sorafenib is a novel oral anticancer agent 
      targeting signal transduction and angiogenic pathways. This study is designed to 
      combine sorafenib and gemcitabine due to their compatibility in preclinical 
      models and nonoverlapping clinical toxicities. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: An initial 
      dose-escalation part of the study enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors, 
      followed by an expanded cohort at the recommended dose for patients with advanced 
      unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Sorafenib is administered 
      continuously, whereas gemcitabine is given at 1,000 mg/m2 weekly x 7 followed by 
      1 rest week, then weekly x 3 every 4 weeks. RESULTS: Forty-two patients have been 
      enrolled overall, including 19 in the dose-escalation part and 23 in the extended 
      pancreatic cancer cohort. Demographics were as follows: male-to-female ratio = 
      26:16; median age = 61 years (range 39-83 years); Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
      Group performance status 0:1:2 ratio = 16:21:5. The recommended dose of this 
      combination is sorafenib 400 mg twice daily and gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2. The most 
      frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events of all causalities were thrombocytopenia 
      (28.6%), lymphopenia (21.4%), lipase elevation (19%), neutropenia (16.7%), and 
      fatigue (14.3%). Antitumor activity was observed in both groups, with 2 (10.5%) 
      confirmed partial responses in ovarian cancer and 12 patients (63.2%) with 
      disease stabilization in the dose-escalation part; 13 patients (56.5%) achieved 
      disease stabilization in the pancreatic cohort. There was no consistent 
      pharmacokinetic drug-to-drug interaction between sorafenib and gemcitabine. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib and gemcitabine are well tolerated in combination; further 
      evaluations in pancreatic and ovarian cancers are warranted.

TI  - Nanoassemblies Based on Supramolecular Complexes of Nonionic Amphiphilic 
      Cyclodextrin and Sorafenib as Effective Weapons to Kill Human HCC Cells.
PG  - 3784-91
LID - 10.1021/acs.biomac.5b01082 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib (Sor), an effective chemiotherapeutic drug utilized against 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), robustly interacts with nonionic amphiphilic 
      cyclodextrin (aCD, SC6OH), forming, in aqueous solution, supramolecular complexes 
      that behave as building blocks of highly water-dispersible colloidal 
      nanoassemblies. SC6OH/Sor complex has been characterized by complementary 
      spectroscopic techniques, such as UV-vis, steady-state fluorescence and 
      anisotropy, resonance light scattering and (1)H NMR. The spectroscopic evidences 
      and experiments carried out in the presence of an adamantane derivative, which 
      competes with drug for CD cavity, agree with the entrapment of Sor in aCD, 
      pointing out the role of the aCD cavity in the interaction between drug and 
      amphiphile. Nanoassemblies based on SC6OH/Sor display size of ∼200 nm, negative 
      zeta-potential (ζ = -11 mV), and both maximum loading capacity (LC ∼ 17%) and 
      entrapment efficiency (EE ∼ 100%). Kinetic release profiles show a slower release 
      of Sor from nanoassemblies with respect to the free drug. SC6OH/Sor 
      nanoassemblies have very low hemolytic activity and high efficiency in vitro in 
      decreasing cell growth and viability of HCC cell lines, such as HepG2, Hep3B, and 
      PLC/PRF/5, opening promising chances to their in vivo applications.

AB  - In this paper, we describe the preparation of polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) 
      loaded with sorafenib for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A 
      synthetic brush copolymer, named PHEA-BIB-ButMA (PBB), was synthesized by Atom 
      Trasnfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP) starting from the 
      α-poly(N-2-hydroxyethyl)-d,l-aspartamide (PHEA) and poly butyl methacrylate 
      (ButMA). Empty and sorafenib loaded PBB NPs were, then, produced by using a 
      dialysis method and showed spherical morphology, colloidal size, negative ζ 
      potential and the ability to allow a sustained sorafenib release in physiological 
      environment. Sorafenib loaded PBB NPs were tested in vitro on HCC cells in order 
      to evaluate their cytocompatibility and anticancer efficacy if compared to free 
      drug. Furthermore, the enhanced anticancer effect of sorafenib loaded PBB NPs was 
      demonstrated in vivo by using a xenograft model, by first allowing Hep3B cells to 
      grow subcutaneously into nude mice and then administering sorafenib as free drug 
      or incorporated into NPs via intraperitoneal injection. Finally, in vivo 
      biodistribution studies were performed, showing the ability of the produced drug 
      delivery system to accumulate in a significant manner in the solid tumor by 
      passive targeting, thanks to the enhanced permeability and retention effect.

AB  - A number of molecularly targeted anticancer drugs that efficiently inhibit 
      receptor tyrosine kinases, socalled receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), 
      have been developed. Although these receptor TKIs are generally well tolerated, 
      unexpected toxicities sometimes occur in various organs. TKI-induced adverse 
      events not only lower the quality of life of cancer patients but also reduce dose 
      intensity, and sometimes result in treatment discontinuation. To reduce adverse 
      drug events and increase treatment efficacy, oncologists and clinical 
      pharmacologists have made efforts to establish strategies to treat patients via 
      optimal selection and dosing of TKIs. Drug efficacy and safety are generally 
      determined by the interplay of multiple processes that regulate pharmacokinetics 
      and pharmacodynamics (toxicodynamics). In this review article, we first provide 
      an overview of adverse events caused by receptor TKIs, focusing on gefitinib, 
      erlotinib, sorafenib and sunitinib, followed by a discussion on the association 
      between pharmacokinetics and toxicities induced by these TKIs, with a focus on 
      establishing optimal personalized treatment strategies by controlling 
      pharmacokinetic properties. Finally, we introduce new findings on the molecular 
      mechanisms of TKIinduced toxicities, elucidated using a new strategy, systems 
      toxicology.

AB  - The present study involves design and synthesis of five series of 
      6-bromo-2-(pyridin-3-yl)-4-substituted quinazolines 9a-l, 11a-e, 13a-c, 14a-f and 
      15a-e. Candidates 9a-l and 11a-e were evaluated for their EGFR and HER2 
      inhibitory activity compared to Lapatinib. Compounds 9b, 9d, 9f, 11b and 11c were 
      further screened for their in vitro cytotoxicity against two human breast cancer 
      cell lines: AU-565 and MDA-MB-231 in addition to normal breast cell line MCF10A. 
      Compound 9d revealed a remarkable cytotoxic efficacy against AU-565 cell line 
      (IC(50) = 1.54 µM) relative to Lapatinib (IC(50) = 0.48 µM), whereas compounds 9d 
      and 11c showed a superior cytotoxicity towards MDA-MB-231 (IC(50) = 2.67 and 
      1.75 µM, respectively) in comparison to Lapatinib (IC(50) = 9.29 µM). Moreover, 
      compounds 13a-c, 13a-c, 14a-f and 15a-e were tested for their VEGFR-2 inhibitory 
      activity compared to Sorafenib. Compounds 13a, 14c and 14e exhibited remarkable 
      inhibition (IC(50) = 79.80, 50.22 and 78.02 nM, respectively) relative to 
      Sorafenib (IC(50) = 51.87 nM). In vitro cytotoxicity of these compounds against 
      HepG2, HCT-116 and normal cell (WISH) revealed a superior cytotoxicity against 
      HepG2, HCT-116 especially 13a (IC(50) = 17.51 and 5.56 µM, respectively) and 14c 
      (IC(50) = 10.40 and 3.37 µM, respectively) compared to Sorafenib (IC(50) = 19.33 
      and 6.82 µM, respectively). Compounds 9d, 11c and 14c were subjected to cell 
      cycle analysis and apoptotic assay. Molecular docking and ADME prediction studies 
      were fulfilled to illustrate the interaction of the potent derivatives with the 
      hot spots of the active site of EGFR, HER2 and VEGFR-2 along with prediction of 
      their pharmacokinetic and physicochemical properties.

AB  - The use of nanocarriers composed of polyethylene glycol- and polyvinyl 
      alcohol-coated vesicles encapsulating active molecules in place of conventional 
      chemotherapy drugs can reduce many of the chemotherapy-associated challenges 
      because of the increased drug concentration at the diseased area in the body. The 
      present study investigated the structure and magnetic properties of iron oxide 
      nanoparticles in the presence of polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene glycol as the 
      basic surface coating agents. We used superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles 
      (FNPs) as the core and studied their effectiveness when two polymers, namely 
      polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG), were used as the coating 
      agents together with magnesium-aluminum-layered double hydroxide (MLDH) as the 
      nanocarrier. In addition, the anticancer drug sorafenib (SO), was loaded on MLDH 
      and coated onto the surface of the nanoparticles, to best exploit this nano-drug 
      delivery system for biomedical applications. Samples were prepared by the 
      co-precipitation method, and the resulting formation of the nanoparticles was 
      confirmed by X-ray, FTIR, TEM, SEM, DLS, HPLC, UV-Vis, TGA and VSM. The X-ray 
      diffraction results indicated that all the as-synthesized samples contained 
      highly crystalline and pure Fe(3)O(4). Transmission electron microscopy analysis 
      showed that the shape of FPEGSO-MLDH nanoparticles was generally spherical, with 
      a mean diameter of 17 nm, compared to 19 nm for FPVASO-MLDH. Fourier transform 
      infrared spectroscopy confirmed the presence of nanocarriers with polymer-coating 
      on the surface of iron oxide nanoparticles and the existence of loaded active 
      drug consisting of sorafenib. Thermogravimetric analyses demonstrated the thermal 
      stability of the nanoparticles, which displayed enhanced anticancer effect after 
      coating. Vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) curves of both produced samples 
      showed superparamagnetic behavior with the high saturation magnetization of 
      57 emu/g for FPEGSO-MLDH and 49 emu/g for FPVASO-MLDH. The scanning electron 
      microscopy (SEM) images showed a narrow size distribution of both final samples. 
      The SO drug loading and the release behavior from FPEGSO-MLDH and FPVASO-MLDH 
      were assessed by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. This evaluation showed around 
      85% drug release within 72 h, while 74% of sorafenib was released in phosphate 
      buffer solution at pH 4.8. The release profiles of sorafenib from the two 
      designed samples were found to be sustained according to pseudo-second-order 
      kinetics. The cytotoxicity studies confirmed the anti-cancer activity of the 
      coated nanoparticles loaded with SO against liver cancer cells, HepG2. 
      Conversely, the drug delivery system was less toxic than the pure drug towards 
      fibroblast-type 3T3 cells.

LID - 10.5507/bp.2015.060 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Na(+)/H(+) exchanger-1 (NHE-1) is involved in pH regulation and is 
      up-regulated in different malignancies. Activation of NHE-1 is one way for 
      allowing cells to avoid intracellular acidification and protect them against 
      apoptosis. Inhibitors of NHE-1 are able to decrease intracellular pH and induce 
      apoptosis. Some statins can also act by partial inhibition of NHE-1. This review 
      presents progress in understanding the mechanisms of action of these inhibitors, 
      connections with certain genetic mutations and acquired treatment resistance, as 
      well as new patents on them. METHODS: A MEDLINE search for original and review 
      articles using key terms, Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, leukemia, cariporide, and 
      amiloride. Recent patents with NHE-1 inhibitors published by United States Patent 
      and Trademark Office are also presented. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib is 
      used for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia patients carrying internal 
      tandem duplication of fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD) mutation. 5-(N, 
      N-hexamethylene)-amiloride can increase the suppression of FLT3 signaling by 
      sorafenib. NHE-1 inhibitors are able to increase the sensitivity of chronic 
      myeloid leukemia cells to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including through the 
      inhibition of P-glycoprotein. NHE-1 inhibitors are promising adjuvant drugs for 
      overcoming acquired resistance to treatment in various malignant hemopathies.

AB  - Sorafenib is a novel oral multikinase inhibitor that targets Raf serine/threonine 
      and receptor tyrosine kinases, and inhibits tumor cell proliferation and 
      angiogenesis. We have conducted a phase I study of sorafenib to determine the 
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and potential efficacy of this agent in 
      31 Japanese patients with advanced refractory solid tumors. Sorafenib (100-600 
      mg) was given as a single dose followed by a 7-day wash-out period, and then 
      administrated twice daily (bid). The most frequent drug-related adverse events 
      were rash/desquamation (61%), hand-foot skin reactions (39%), diarrhea (36%), and 
      elevations of serum lipase (36%) and amylase (26%) levels. Dose-limiting 
      toxicities (DLTs) were grade 3 diarrhea at 200 mg bid and grade 3 fatigue at 600 
      mg bid. Grade 3 and 4 pancreatic enzyme elevations were observed at 200-600 mg 
      bid, but they were not deemed dose-limiting because they were asymptomatic and 
      were not associated with pancreatitis or chronic damage to the pancreas. The AUC 
      and C(max) of sorafenib increased linearly with dose up to 400 mg bid. Partial 
      responses were observed in one of 10 patients with non-small cell lung cancer and 
      one of three patients with renal cell carcinoma. In conclusion, sorafenib 400 mg 
      bid was well tolerated in Japanese patients with advanced refractory solid 
      tumors. The recommended dose for future clinical trials is 400 mg bid.

AB  - Liver fibrosis is a chronic disease resulting from repetitive or prolonged liver 
      injury with limited treatment options. Sorafenib has been reported to be a 
      potential antifibrotic agent; however, its therapeutic effect is restricted 
      because of its low bioavailability and severe adverse effects in the 
      gastrointestinal (GI) tract. In this study, we developed sorafenib-loaded 
      silica-containing redox nanoparticles (sora@siRNP) as an oral nanomedicine to 
      treat liver fibrosis. The designed siRNP were prepared by self-assembly of 
      amphiphilic block copolymers, which possess antioxidant nitroxide radicals as a 
      side chain of the hydrophobic segment and porous silica particles in the 
      nanoparticle core. The silica moieties in the core formed a crosslink between the 
      self-assembling block copolymers to afford stable drug absorption, which could be 
      useful in harsh GI conditions after oral drug administration. Based on in vitro 
      evaluation, sora@siRNP exerted antiproliferative and antifibrotic effects against 
      hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and low toxicity against normal endothelial cells. 
      A pharmacokinetic study showed that siRNP significantly improved the 
      bioavailability and distribution of sorafenib in the liver. In an in vivo study 
      using a mouse model of CCl(4)-induced liver fibrosis, oral administration of 
      sora@siRNP significantly suppressed the fibrotic area in comparison to free 
      sorafenib administration. In mice with CCl(4)-induced fibrosis, free sorafenib 
      administration did not suppress the expression of α-smooth muscle actin; however, 
      mice treated with sora@siRNP showed significantly suppressed expression of 
      α-smooth muscle actin, indicating the inhibition of HSC activation, which was 
      confirmed by in vitro experiments. Moreover, oral administration of free 
      sorafenib induced severe intestinal damage and increased leakage into the gut, 
      which can be attributed to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our 
      antioxidant nanocarriers, siRNP, reduced the adverse effects of local ROS 
      scavenging in the GI tract. Our results suggest that sora@siRNP could serve as a 
      promising oral nanomedicine for liver fibrosis.

TI  - Phase I and Preliminary Phase II Study of TRC105 in Combination with Sorafenib in 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 4633-4641
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-16-3171 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Endoglin (CD105) is an endothelial cell membrane receptor highly 
      expressed on proliferating tumor vasculature, including that of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC), and is associated with poor prognosis. Endoglin is essential for 
      angiogenesis, and its expression is induced by hypoxia and VEGF pathway 
      inhibition. TRC105 is a chimeric IgG1 CD105 mAb that inhibits angiogenesis and 
      causes antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and apoptosis of proliferating 
      endothelium.Experimental Design: Patients with HCC (Child-Pugh A/B7), ECOG 0/1, 
      were enrolled in a phase I study of TRC105 at 3, 6, 10, and 15 mg/kg every 2 
      weeks given with sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. Correlative biomarkers included 
      DCE-MRI and plasma levels of angiogenic factors, including soluble endoglin. 
      Pharmacokinetics were assessed in serum.Results: Twenty-six patients were 
      enrolled, of whom 25 received treatment, 15 with cirrhosis. Hep B/C: 3/15; M:F 
      19:6; mean age of 60 (range, 18-76); 1 DLT (grade 3 AST) occurred at 10 mg/kg. 
      The most frequent toxicity was low-grade epistaxis, a known toxicity of TRC105. 
      One patient experienced an infusion reaction and was replaced. One patient with 
      coronary stenosis developed a fatal myocardial infarction, and one patient 
      developed G3 cerebral tumor hemorrhage. MTD was not established and DL4 (15 
      mg/kg) was expanded. The overall response rate in 24 evaluable patients at all 4 
      dose levels was 21% [95% confidence interval (CI), 7.1-42.2], and 25% (95% CI, 
      8.7-49.1) in patients with measureable disease. Four patients had confirmed 
      stable disease, one of whom was treated for 22 months. Median progression-free 
      survival (PFS) for 24 patients evaluable for PFS was 3.8 months (95% CI, 3.2-5.6 
      months); median overall survival was 15.5 months (95% CI, 8.5-26.3 
      months).Conclusions: TRC105 combined with sorafenib was well tolerated at the 
      recommended single agent doses of both drugs. Encouraging evidence of activity to 
      date (PR rate 25%) was observed, and the study is now continuing to recruit in 
      the phase II stage as a multicenter study to confirm activity of the combination.

TI  - Lack of effect of ketoconazole-mediated CYP3A inhibition on sorafenib clinical 
      pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 685-92
AB  - Sorafenib is a novel, small-molecule anticancer compound that inhibits tumor cell 
      proliferation by targeting Raf in the Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway, and 
      inhibits angiogenesis by targeting tyrosine kinases such as vascular-endothelial 
      growth factor receptor (VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3) and platelet-derived growth factor 
      receptor (PDGFR). In vitro microsomal data indicate that sorafenib is metabolized 
      by two pathways: phase I oxidation mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4; and 
      phase II conjugation mediated by UGT1A9. Approximately 50% of an orally 
      administered dose is recovered as unchanged drug in the feces, due to either 
      biliary excretion or lack of absorption. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
      the effect of CYP3A inhibition by ketoconazole on sorafenib pharmacokinetics. 
      This was an open-label, non-randomized, 2-period, one-way crossover study in 
      sixteen healthy male subjects. A single 50 mg dose of sorafenib was administered 
      alone (period 1) and in combination with ketoconazole 400 mg once daily (period 
      2) (ketoconazole was given for 7 days, and a single 50 mg sorafenib dose was 
      administered concomitantly on day 4). No clinically relevant change in 
      pharmacokinetics of sorafenib and no clinically relevant adverse events or 
      laboratory abnormalities were observed in this study upon co-administration of 
      the two drugs. Plasma concentrations of the main CYP3A4 generated metabolite, 
      sorafenib N-oxide, decreased considerably upon ketoconazole co-administration. 
      This effect is in accordance with the in vitro finding that CYP3A4 is the primary 
      enzyme for sorafenib N-oxide formation. Further, these data indicate that 
      blocking sorafenib metabolism by the CYP3A4 pathway will not lead to an increase 
      in sorafenib exposure. This is consistent with data from a clinical mass-balance 
      study that showed 15% of the administered dose was eliminated by glucuronidation, 
      compared to less than 5% eliminated as oxidative metabolites. Since there was no 
      increase in sorafenib exposure following concomitant administration of the highly 
      potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole with low dose sorafenib, it is postulated 
      that higher therapeutic doses of sorafenib may be safely co-administered with 
      ketoconazole, as well as with other inhibitors of CYP3A.

AB  - A novel nanocrystals delivery system of parthenolide (PTL) was designed to 
      combined application with sorafenib (Sora) for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) therapy, attempting to not only improve the poor aqueous solubility of PTL, 
      but also enhance the synergistic therapeutic effects with Sora. The PTL 
      nanocrystals (PTL-NCs) were prepared by precipitation-high-pressure 
      homogenization method. The formed PTL-NCs with rod morphology possessed size of 
      126.9 ± 2.31 nm, zeta potential of -11.18 ± 0.59 mV and drug loading of 
      31.11 ± 1.99%. Meanwhile, PTL in PTL-NCs exhibited excellent storage stability 
      and sustained release behavior. The combination therapy of Sora and PTL-NCs 
      (Sora/PTL-NCs) in vitro for HepG2 cells presented superior therapeutic effects 
      over that of individual PTL and Sora on intracellular uptake, cell proliferation 
      inhibition and migration inhibition. Meanwhile the strongest anti-tumor effect 
      with 81.86% inhibition rate and minimized systemic toxicity of Sora/PTL-NCs in 
      vivo were obtained on tumor-bearing mice compared with that of PTL (48.84%) and 
      Sora (58.83%). Thus, these findings suggested that PTL-NCs as an effective 
      delivery system for the synergistically used with Sora to gain an optimal 
      response against HCC, for referenced in the industrialization of nanocrystals 
      products for intravenous administration.

AB  - Here, the potential of two nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) for controlled 
      release of sorafenib was evaluated. The obtained systems showed characteristics 
      suitable as drug delivery systems for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) through parenteral administration. The use of a mixture between a solid 
      lipid (tripalmitin) with a liquid lipid (Captex 355 EP/NF or Miglyol 812) to 
      prepare NLC systems could give a higher drug loading capacity and a longer term 
      stability during storage than that obtained by using only solid lipids. The 
      obtained nanoparticles showed a nanometer size and high negative zeta potential 
      values. Scansion electron microscopy (SEM) of the sorafenib loaded NLC revealed a 
      spherical shape with a diameter <300 nm. In vitro biological studies demonstrated 
      that sorafenib loaded into NLC had enhanced anti-tumor activity compared to that 
      of free drug. This finding raises hope in terms of future drug delivery strategy 
      of sorafenib loaded NLC, that can be useful for therapeutic application in HCC.

AB  - AIM: This novel multiparameter Phase I study aimed to optimize doses/dosing 
      schedules of everolimus and sorafenib drug combination, based on 
      modeling/simulation (NCT01932177). PATIENTS & METHODS: About 26 patients with 
      solid tumors were treated in four different dosing schedules. Everolimus once 
      daily + sorafenib twice daily were given continuously in arms A and B, and 
      intermittently in arms C (alternating every other week) and D (everolimus 
      continuous and sorafenib 3 days on/4 days off). RESULTS: Continuous schedules 
      exhibited higher toxicity risks than intermittent schedules (64.1 vs 35.9%; p < 
      0.0001), and trends for lower disease control rates (80 vs 100%). No significant 
      pharmacokinetic interaction was identified. CONCLUSION: Feasibility of EVESOR 
      trial is demonstrated. Intermittent schedules might provide better tolerance and 
      efficacy than continuous schedules.

TI  - Axitinib for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma.
PG  - 283-97
LID - 10.1517/14656566.2014.868436 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Advanced understanding of the pathogenesis of renal cell carcinoma 
      (RCC) has led to development and approval of several molecularly targeted 
      therapies since 2005. Axitinib is a potent and selective inhibitor of vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2 and 3. In the randomized Phase III AXIS 
      trial, axitinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival compared with 
      sorafenib, respectively (6.7 vs 4.7 months; p < 0.0001), and improved objective 
      response rate (19 vs 9%; p = 0.0001), resulting in its approval for advanced or 
      metastatic RCC after failure of one systemic therapy. However, overall survival 
      was similar with axitinib and sorafenib. Common adverse events associated with 
      axitinib include diarrhea, hypertension and fatigue. AREAS COVERED: The 
      properties, clinical efficacy, adverse events, pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics of axitinib are summarized and its position in the overall 
      therapeutic landscape for metastatic RCC among several targeted therapies is 
      described. EXPERT OPINION: Axitinib is generally well-tolerated and provides 
      definitive clinical benefits in patients with advanced or metastatic RCC as 
      second-line therapy. However, as with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors of the 
      same class, axitinib does not prolong overall survival; therefore, selection of 
      second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, including axitinib, must be 
      carefully considered to maximize outcomes for each patient.

TI  - A multicenter phase II study of erlotinib and sorafenib in chemotherapy-naive 
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
PG  - 3078-87
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-3033 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This multicenter, phase II study evaluates the efficacy and safety of 
      erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, plus sorafenib, 
      a multityrosine kinase inhibitor against vascular endothelial growth factor 
      receptors, in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung 
      cancer (NSCLC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Chemotherapy-naïve patients with stage 
      IIIB/IV NSCLC received erlotinib (150 mg once a day) and sorafenib (400 mg twice 
      a day) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point 
      was the rate of nonprogression at 6 weeks. Secondary end points included 
      objective response rate (ORR), time to progression, overall survival, and adverse 
      events. Exploratory end points included pretreatment EGFR and KRAS mutation 
      status, pharmacokinetics, and cytochrome P450 polymorphisms. RESULTS: Fifty 
      patients initiated therapy. The nonprogression rate at 6 weeks was 74%: 12 (24%) 
      partial response and 25 (50%) stable disease. Ultimately, the ORR was 28%. Median 
      time to progression was 5.0 months [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 3.2-6.8 
      months]. Median overall survival was 10.9 months (95% CI, 3.8-18.1 months). Grade 
      3/4 adverse events included fatigue (16%), hand-foot skin reaction (16%), rash 
      (16%), diarrhea (14%), and hypophosphatemia (42%). There was one 
      treatment-related fatal pulmonary hemorrhage. Patients with wild-type EGFR had a 
      higher ORR (19%) than previously reported for single-agent erlotinib/sorafenib. 
      Erlotinib levels were lowered. This was associated with CYP3A4 polymorphism and 
      was possibly due to sorafenib. CONCLUSION: Despite a possible drug interaction, 
      sorafenib plus erlotinib has promising clinical activity in patients with stage 
      IIIB/IV NSCLC and has an acceptable safety profile. Further evaluation of this 
      combination as potential salvage therapy in EGFR mutation-negative patients and 
      the possible drug interaction is warranted.

TI  - A Multifunctional Lipid-Based Nanodevice for the Highly Specific Codelivery of 
      Sorafenib and Midkine siRNA to Hepatic Cancer Cells.
PG  - 4031-4044
LID - 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.9b00738 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a common deadly malignancy, requires novel 
      therapeutic strategies to improve the survival rate. Combining chemotherapy and 
      gene therapy is a promising approach for increasing efficiency and reducing side 
      effects. We report on the design of highly specific lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) 
      encapsulating both the chemotherapeutic drug, sorafenib (SOR), and siRNA against 
      the midkine gene (MK), thereby conferring a novel highly efficient anticancer 
      effect on HCC. The LNPs were modified with a targeting peptide, SP94, which is 
      selective for hepatic cancer cells (HCCs), thus permitting the specific delivery 
      of the payload. MK-siRNA increased the sensitivity of HCCs, HepG2, to SOR (IC(50) 
      for SOR+MK-siRNA: 5 ± 1.50 μM compared to 9 ± 2.20 and 17 ± 2.60 μM for 
      SOR+control siRNA and MK-siRNA, respectively). The selectivity was confirmed by 
      cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, and gene-silencing studies in HCCs, HepG2, and 
      Hepa 1-6, compared to other cancerous cells, HeLa, and normal cells, FL83B. The 
      use of a novel pH-sensitive lipid, YSK05, increased the cytotoxic and gene 
      knockdown efficiencies and limited extracellular drug release. The nanoparticles 
      were also compatible with serum and showed no aggregation after long storage. The 
      efficient and specific codelivery system reported here is a highly promising 
      strategy for the treatment of HCC.

TI  - Phase I trial of a combination of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib and the 
      farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib in advanced malignancies.
PG  - 7061-8
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-1241 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated the safety, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics, and 
      biological effects of the combination of the Raf-1, RET, KIT, platelet-derived 
      growth factor receptor, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 kinase 
      inhibitor sorafenib and the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib. 
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A standard 3 + 3 phase I dose-escalation design was used 
      with a 28-day cycle (sorafenib daily and tipifarnib for 21 days, by mouth). 
      RESULTS: Fifty patients were treated; 43 reached restaging evaluation after cycle 
      2. The most common side effects were grade 1 to 2 rash, hyperglycemia, and 
      diarrhea. Dose-limiting toxicity was rash, and the recommended phase II dose is 
      sorafenib 400 mg p.o. qam/200 mg p.o. qpm and tipifarnib p.o. 100 mg bd. Despite 
      the low doses of tipifarnib, one quarter of patients had > or =50% reduction in 
      farnesyltransferase levels. Interestingly, six of eight patients with medullary 
      thyroid cancer had durable stable disease (n = 3) or partial remissions (n = 3), 
      lasting 12 to 26+ months. Five of the six responders had available tissue, and 
      RET gene mutations were identified in them. Prolonged (> or =6 months) stable 
      disease was also seen in nine patients as follows: papillary thyroid cancer (n = 
      4; 18+ to 27+ months), adrenocortical cancer (n = 2; 7 and 11 months), and one 
      each of melanoma (platelet-derived growth factor receptor mutation positive; 14 
      months), renal (6 months), and pancreatic cancer (6 months). CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      study shows that the combination of tipifarnib and sorafenib is well tolerated. 
      Activity was seen, especially in patients with medullary thyroid cancer, a tumor 
      characterized by RET mutations.

AB  - Blood vessels, the extracellular space, and the cell membrane represent 
      physiologic barriers to nanoparticle-based drug delivery for cancer therapy. We 
      demonstrate that electroporation (EP) can assist in the delivery of dye 
      stabilized sorafenib nanoparticles (SFB-IR783) by increasing the permeability of 
      endothelial monolayers, improving diffusion through the extracellular space in 
      tumorspheres, and by disrupting plasma membrane function in cancer cells. These 
      changes occur in a dose-dependent fashion, increasing proportionally with 
      electric field strength. Cell death from irreversible electroporation (IRE) was 
      observed to contribute to the persistent transport of SFB-IR783 through these 
      physiologic barriers. In a model of mice bearing bilateral xenograft HCT116 
      colorectal tumors, treatment with EP resulted in the immediate and increased 
      uptake of SFB-IR783 when compared with the untreated contralateral tumor. The 
      uptake of SFB-IR783 was independent of direct transfection of cells through EP 
      and was mediated by changes in vascular permeability and extracellular diffusion. 
      The combination of EP and SFB-IR783 was observed to result in 40% reduction in 
      mean tumor diameter when compared with sham treatment (p < .05) at the time of 
      sacrifice, which was not observed in cohorts treated with EP alone or SFB-IR783 
      alone. Treatment of tumor with EP can augment the uptake and increase the 
      efficacy of nanoparticle therapy.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether genetic variants that 
      influence angiogenesis and sorafenib pharmacokinetics are associated with 
      clinical outcomes and toxic effects in advanced renal cell carcinoma patients 
      treated with this drug. One hundred patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma 
      were enrolled. Forty-two polymorphisms in 15 genes were selected for genotyping 
      and analyzed for associations with progression-free survival, overall survival, 
      and toxic effects. We found that rs1570360 in VEGF and rs2239702 in VEGFR2 were 
      significantly associated with progression-free. Specifically, patients carrying 
      the variant genotypes (AG + AA) of these two polymorphisms both had an 
      unfavorable progression-free. In addition, compared with those with the rs2239702 
      GG genotype, patients with the AG + AA genotype suffered an unfavorable OS. We 
      found that the VEGF rs2010963 CG + GG genotypes had a significantly increased 
      risk of hand-foot syndrome, and the ABCB1 rs1045642 CT + TT genotypes had an 
      increased risk of high blood pressure. Our results suggest that polymorphisms in 
      VEGF and VEGFR2 are associated with sorafenib clinical outcomes, and 
      polymorphisms in VEGF and ABCB1 are associated with sorafenib-related toxicities. 
      Larger studies are warranted to validate our findings.

TI  - Quantitative determination of regorafenib and its two major metabolites in human 
      plasma with high-performance liquid chromatography and ultraviolet detection.
PG  - 1611-7
LID - 10.1002/bmc.3730 [doi]
AB  - A simple, highly sensitive and specific high-performance liquid chromatography 
      (HPLC) method was developed for the simultaneous quantitation of regorafenib, 
      N-oxidemetabolite (M-2) and the desmethyl N-oxide metabolite (M-5) in human 
      plasma. Regorafenib, M-2, M-5 and the internal standard sorafenib were separated 
      using a mobile phase of 0.5% KH2 PO4 (pH 3.5)-acetonitrile (30:70, v/v), on a 
      Capcell PAK MG II column at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and measurement at UV 
      260 nm. The lower limits of quantification for regorafenib, M-2 and M-5 were 
      10 ng/mL for each analyte. A procedure using solid-phase extraction required only 
      a small amount of plasma (100 μL) for one analysis while providing high 
      extraction recovery (>81% for all compounds) and good selectivity. Coefficients 
      of variation for intra- and inter-day assays were <12.2% for regorafenib, <12.3% 
      for M-2 and <15.1% for M-5. Accuracies for intra- and inter-day assays were <9.4% 
      for regorafenib, <8.0% for M-2 and <12.8% for M-5 over a linear range from 10 to 
      10,000 ng/mL. This HPLC assay is suitable for clinical pharmacokinetic studies of 
      regorafenib. The present HPLC method is currently in use for our observational 
      studies of patients under treatment. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Effects of the kinase inhibitor sorafenib on heart, muscle, liver and plasma 
      metabolism in vivo using non-targeted metabolomics analysis.
PG  - 4797-4811
LID - 10.1111/bph.14062 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The human kinome consists of roughly 500 kinases, 
      including 150 that have been proposed as therapeutic targets. Protein kinases 
      regulate an array of signalling pathways that control metabolism, cell cycle 
      progression, cell death, differentiation and survival. It is not surprising, 
      then, that new kinase inhibitors developed to treat cancer, including sorafenib, 
      also exhibit cardiotoxicity. We hypothesized that sorafenib cardiotoxicity is 
      related to its deleterious effects on specific cardiac metabolic pathways given 
      the critical roles of protein kinases in cardiac metabolism. EXPERIMENTAL 
      APPROACH: FVB/N mice (10 per group) were challenged with sorafenib or vehicle 
      control daily for 2 weeks. Echocardiographic assessment of the heart identified 
      systolic dysfunction consistent with cardiotoxicity in sorafenib-treated mice 
      compared to vehicle-treated controls. Heart, skeletal muscle, liver and plasma 
      were flash frozen and prepped for non-targeted GC-MS metabolomics analysis. KEY 
      RESULTS: Compared to vehicle-treated controls, sorafenib-treated hearts exhibited 
      significant alterations in 11 metabolites, including markedly altered 
      taurine/hypotaurine metabolism (25-fold enrichment), identified by pathway 
      enrichment analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These studies identified 
      alterations in taurine/hypotaurine metabolism in the hearts and skeletal muscles 
      of mice treated with sorafenib. Interventions that rescue or prevent these 
      sorafenib-induced changes, such as taurine supplementation, may be helpful in 
      attenuating sorafenib-induced cardiac injury.

TI  - A dual-targeting reconstituted high density lipoprotein leveraging the synergy of 
      sorafenib and antimiRNA21 for enhanced hepatocellular carcinoma therapy.

AB  - Sorafenib (So) is a multi-target kinase inhibitor extensively used in clinic for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma therapy. It demonstrated strong inhibition both in tumor 
      proliferation and tumor angiogenesis, while hampered by associated cutaneous 
      side-effect and drug resistance. The knockdown of miR-21 with antisense 
      oligonucleotides (antimiRNA21) was regarded as an efficient strategy for 
      increasing tumor sensibility to chemotherapy, which could be employed to 
      appreciate the efficacy of So. Herein, we successfully formulated a 
      dual-targeting delivery system for enhanced hepatocellular carcinoma therapy by 
      encapsulating So and antimiRNA21 in RGD pentapeptide-modified reconstituted 
      high-density lipoprotein (RGD-rHDL/So/antimiRNA21). The RGD and apolipoprotein 
      A-I (ApoA-I) on nanoparticles (NPs) could drive the system simultaneously to 
      tumor neovascular and parenchyma by binding to the overexpressed ανβ3-integrin 
      and SR-B1 receptors, achieving precise delivery of therapeutics to maximize the 
      efficacy. A series in vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that co-delivery of 
      So and antimiRNA21 by RGD-rHDL significantly strengthened the anti-tumor and 
      anti-angiogenic effect of So with negligible toxicity towards major organs, 
      reversed drug-resistance and was capable of remodeling tumor environments. The 
      constructed RGD-rHDL/So/antimiRNA21 with improved efficacy and excellent tumor 
      targeting ability provided new idea for chemo-gene combined therapy in 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Sorafenib (So) is a 
      multi-target kinase inhibitor which was approved by FDA as first-line drug for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy. However, long term application of So in 
      clinic was hampered by serious dermal toxicity and drug resistance. Although 
      numerous researchers were devoted to finding alternatives or therapies as 
      combination treatments with So to reach more desired therapeutic efficacy, the 
      therapeutic options were still limited. The present study prepares RGD 
      pentapeptide decorated biomimic reconstituted high-density lipoprotein (rHDL) 
      loaded with So and antimiRNA21 (RGD-rHDL/So/antimiRNA21) for enhanced HCC 
      therapy. The RGD-rHDL/So/antimiRNA21 NPs offer an effective platform for 
      anti-tumor and anti-angiogenesis therapy in HCC and provide new approach to 
      reverse drug-resistance of So for feasible clinical application.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the fastest growing causes of cancer-related 
      mortality worldwide. Sorafenib was the first and only drug to improve survival 
      for patients with advanced disease, and has been the cornerstone of treatment for 
      nearly a decade. Regorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that has recently been 
      shown to significantly improve survival in patients who have progressed on 
      first-line sorafenib. In this review, we discuss the pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamics properties of regorafenib and its efficacy and tolerability in 
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

TI  - A pharmacodynamic study of sorafenib in patients with relapsed and refractory 
      acute leukemias.
PG  - 1437-44
LID - 10.1038/leu.2010.132 [doi]
AB  - We report the results of a phase I dose escalation trial of the multikinase 
      inhibitor sorafenib in relapsed and refractory acute leukemia patients using an 
      intermittent dosing regimen. Fifteen patients with advanced leukemia (12 with 
      acute myeloid leukemia, 2 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 1 with biphenotypic) 
      and a median age of 63 (range 37-85) years were enrolled and treated on a dose 
      escalation trial. Toxicities >or=grade 3 were present in 55% of cycles and the 
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined to be 400 mg b.i.d. x 21 days in a 
      28-day cycle. Plasma inhibitory assays of kinase targets extracellular 
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) showed 
      excellent target inhibition, with FLT3-ITD silencing occurring below the MTD. The 
      N-oxide metabolite of sorafenib seemed to be a more potent inhibitor of FLT3-ITD 
      than the parent compound. Despite marked ex vivo FLT-3 ITD inhibition, no 
      patients met the criteria for complete or partial response in this monotherapy 
      study. Out of 15 patients, 11 experienced stable disease as best response. 
      Although sorafenib showed only modest clinical activity as a single agent in this 
      heavily treated population, robust inhibition of FLT3 and ERK suggests that there 
      may be a potential important role in combination therapies.

TI  - A LC-MS/MS method for therapeutic drug monitoring of sorafenib, regorafenib and 
      their active metabolites in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

LID - S0731-7085(20)30227-2 [pii]

AB  - A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed 
      and validated for the simultaneous quantification of sorafenib (SORA), its 
      N-oxide active metabolite and of regorafenib (REGO) and its two active 
      metabolites regorafenib N-oxide and N-desmethyl regorafenib N-oxide in 
      hepatocellular carcinoma patients' plasma. A proper analytes' separation was 
      obtained with Synergi Fusion RP column (4 μm, 80 Å, 50 × 2.0 mm) using a gradient 
      elution of 10 mM ammonium acetate with 0.1% formic acid (mobile phase A) and 
      methanol:isopropanol (90:10, v/v, mobile phase B) containing 0.1% formic acid. 
      The analysis was then performed by electrospray ionization in negative mode 
      coupled with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometry, API 4000QT, monitoring two 
      transitions for each analyte, one for the quantification and the other for 
      confirmation. The method could be easily applied to the clinical practice thanks 
      to the short run (7 min), the low amount of patient plasma necessary for the 
      analysis (5 μL) and the fast sample processing based on protein precipitation. 
      The method was therefore fully validated according to FDA and EMA guidelines. The 
      linearity was assessed (R(2)≥0.998) over the concentration ranges of 
      50-8000 ng/mL for SORA and REGO, and 30-4000 ng/mL for their metabolites, that 
      appropriately cover the therapeutic plasma concentrations. The presented method 
      also showed adequate results in terms of intra- and inter-day accuracy and 
      precision (CV ≤ 7.2% and accuracy between 89.4% and 108.8%), recovery (≥85.5%), 
      sensitivity, analytes stability under various conditions and the absence of the 
      matrix effect. Once the validation was successfully completed, the method was 
      applied to perform the C(min) quantification of SORA, REGO and their metabolites 
      in 54 plasma samples collected from patients enrolled in a clinical study ongoing 
      at the National Cancer Institute of Aviano.

PG  - 1171-89
LID - 10.1517/14656566.2011.571206 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dramatic advances in the care of patients with advanced renal cell 
      carcinoma (RCC) have occurred over the last 10 years. Insights into the molecular 
      pathogenesis of this disease have elucidated the importance of signaling cascades 
      related to angiogenesis in the management of RCC. Pazopanib is a novel, 
      small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth 
      factor receptors (VEGFR)-1, -2, and -3; platelet-derived growth factor receptors 
      (PDGFR)-α and -β; and c-kit tyrosine kinases. Pazopanib exhibits distinct 
      pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles compared with other agents in the class of 
      VEGF signaling pathway inhibitors. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the 
      scientific rationale for the development of pazopanib, as well as the preclinical 
      and clinical trials that led to the approval of pazopanib for patients with 
      advanced RCC. The most recent information, including data from the 2010 meeting 
      of the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the design of ongoing Phase III 
      trials, is discussed. Finally, an algorithm utilizing level I evidence for the 
      treatment of patients with this disease is proposed. EXPERT OPINION: The 
      treatment of metastatic RCC has changed dramatically over the last 5 years. Six 
      novel agents - sunitinib, sorafenib, temsirolimus, everolimus, bevacizumab (used 
      in combination with interferon), and pazopanib (Votrient) - have been approved 
      for the treatment of metastatic RCC. The clinical data to date clearly place 
      pazopanib among the most active of the targeted therapies.

TI  - Phase I study of sorafenib in combination with docetaxel and prednisone in 
      chemo-naïve patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
PG  - 293-303

AB  - PURPOSE: We performed a dose-escalation study to investigate the safety of 
      sorafenib in combination with docetaxel and prednisone in chemo-naïve patients 
      with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). METHODS: Six 
      patients were included per dose level. Following docetaxel infusion on day 1 
      (75 mg/m(2)/q3 weeks), sorafenib was administered at 200 mg BID on days 2-19 
      (dose level 1), at 200 mg BID on days 1-21 (dose level 2), at 400 mg BID on days 
      2-19 (dose level 3), at 400 mg BID on days 1-21 (dose level 4). Maximal tolerated 
      dose (MTD) was exceeded if ≥2 patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) 
      during cycle 1. The recommended phase 2 dose for sorafenib was defined as one 
      dose level below MTD. If MTD was not reached, the highest feasible dose would be 
      selected to treat an expanded cohort to confirm safety. RESULTS: Two DLTs were 
      observed during sorafenib dose-escalation consisting of grade 4 febrile 
      neutropenia (dose level 2) and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome (HFS) (dose level 3). 
      Our pharmacokinetic results showed an increased exposure to docetaxel across all 
      dose levels during sorafenib comedication. The main grade ≥3 toxicities were 
      neutropenia (35 %), HFS (27 %), and febrile neutropenia (19 %). The 
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate was 74 %. Median overall survival 
      was 25.2 months. CONCLUSION: Three-weekly docetaxel and prednisone could be 
      combined with sorafenib at 400 mg BID on days 1-21 without reaching MTD. However, 
      we observed a pharmacokinetic interaction between sorafenib and docetaxel, 
      associated with significant toxicities, raising concerns about the safety of this 
      combination in mCRPC.

TI  - Preclincial testing of sorafenib and RAD001 in the Nf(flox/flox) ;DhhCre mouse 
      model of plexiform neurofibroma using magnetic resonance imaging.
PG  - 173-80
LID - 10.1002/pbc.23015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an inherited disease predisposing 
      affected patients to variable numbers of benign neurofibromas. To date there are 
      no effective chemotherapeutic drugs available for this slow growing tumor. 
      Molecularly targeted agents that aim to slow neurofibroma growth are being tested 
      in clinical trials. So preclinical models for testing potential therapies are 
      urgently needed to prioritize drugs for clinical trials of neurofibromas. 
      PROCEDURE: We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor neurofibroma 
      development in the Nf1(flox/flox) ;DhhCre mouse model of GEM grade I 
      neurofibroma. Based on studies implicating mTOR and Raf signaling in NF1 mutant 
      cells, we tested the therapeutic effect of RAD001 and Sorafenib in this model. 
      Mice were scanned to establish growth rate followed by 8 weeks of drug treatment, 
      then re-imaged after the last dose of drug treatment. Tumor volumes were 
      determined by volumetric measurement. RESULTS: We found that rate of tumor growth 
      varied among mice, as it does in human patients. RAD001 inhibited its predicted 
      target pS6K, yet there was no significant decrease in the tumor volume in RAD001 
      treated mice compared to the vehicle control group. Sorafenib inhibited cyclinD1 
      expression and cell proliferation in tumors, and volumetric measurements 
      identified significant decreases in tumor volume in some mice. CONCLUSION: The 
      data demonstrate that volumetric MRI analysis can be used to monitor the 
      therapeutic effect in the preclinical neurofibroma drug screening, and suggest 
      that Sorafenib might have clinical activity in some neurofibromas.

TI  - Sorafenib: a review of its use in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 223-40

AB  - Sorafenib (Nexavar) is an orally active multikinase inhibitor that is approved in 
      the EU for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Monotherapy with sorafenib 
      prolongs overall survival and delays the time to progression in patients with 
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma who are not candidates for potentially curative 
      treatment or transarterial chemoembolization. Sorafenib is generally well 
      tolerated in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, sorafenib 
      represents an important advance in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma and is the new standard of care for this condition. The bi-aryl urea 
      sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that inhibits cell surface tyrosine 
      kinase receptors (e.g. vascular endothelial growth factor receptors and 
      platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta) and downstream intracellular 
      serine/threonine kinases (e.g. Raf-1, wild-type B-Raf and mutant B-Raf); these 
      kinases are involved in tumour cell proliferation and tumour angiogenesis. In 
      vitro, dose-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis 
      was seen with sorafenib in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells lines. Sorafenib 
      demonstrated dose-dependent antitumour activity in a murine xenograft model of 
      human hepatocellular carcinoma. Steady-state plasma concentrations were reached 
      within 7 days in patients with advanced, refractory solid tumours who received 
      twice-daily oral sorafenib. Metabolism of sorafenib occurs primarily in the liver 
      and is mediated via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and uridine diphosphate 
      glucuronosyltransferase 1A9. In advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, differences in 
      sorafenib pharmacokinetics between Child-Pugh A and B patients were not 
      considered clinically significant. Sorafenib may be associated with drug 
      interactions. For example, sorafenib exposure was reduced by an average 37% with 
      concomitant administration of the CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin (rifampin); sorafenib 
      concentrations may also be decreased by other CYP3A4 inducers. Monotherapy with 
      oral sorafenib 400 mg twice daily prolonged median overall survival and delayed 
      the median time to progression in patients with advanced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma, according to the results of two randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase III trials (the SHARP trial and the 
      Asia-Pacific trial). There was no significant difference between sorafenib and 
      placebo recipients in the median time to symptomatic progression in either trial. 
      The vast majority of patients included in these trials were Child-Pugh A. 
      Combination therapy with sorafenib plus doxorubicin did not delay the median time 
      to progression to a significant extent compared with doxorubicin alone in 
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, according to the results of a 
      randomized, double-blind, phase II trial. However, the median durations of 
      overall survival and progression-free survival were significantly longer in 
      patients receiving sorafenib plus doxorubicin than in those receiving doxorubicin 
      alone. Combination therapy with sorafenib plus tegafur/uracil or mitomycin also 
      showed potential in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, according to the results 
      of noncomparative trials. Monotherapy with oral sorafenib was generally well 
      tolerated in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, with a manageable 
      adverse effect profile; diarrhoea and hand-foot skin reaction were consistently 
      the most commonly occurring drug-related adverse events in clinical trials. In 
      the SHARP trial, drug-related adverse events of any grade occurring in 
      significantly more sorafenib than placebo recipients included diarrhoea, 
      hand-foot skin reaction, anorexia, alopecia, weight loss, dry skin, abdominal 
      pain, voice changes and 'other' dermatological events. A similar tolerability 
      profile was seen in the Asia-Pacific trial. As expected given the addition of a 
      chemotherapy agent, the adverse event profile in patients with advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma who received combination therapy with sorafenib plus 
      doxorubicin differed somewhat to that seen with sorafenib monotherapy in the 
      SHARP trial. In patients receiving sorafenib plus doxorubicin, the most commonly 
      occurring all-cause adverse events (all grades) included fatigue, neutropenia, 
      diarrhoea, elevated bilirubin levels, abdominal pain, hand-foot skin reaction, 
      left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension and febrile neutropenia.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to provide a pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and 
      toxicokinetics/toxicodynamics bridging of kinase inhibitors by identifying the 
      relationship between their clinical and preclinical (rat, dog, and monkey) data 
      on exposure and efficacy/toxicity. For the eight kinase inhibitors approved in 
      Japan (imatinib, gefitinib, erlotinib, sorafenib, sunitinib, nilotinib, 
      dasatinib, and lapatinib), the human unbound area under the concentration-time 
      curve at steady state (AUC(ss,u)) at the clinical dose correlated well with 
      animal AUC(ss,u) at the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) or maximum 
      tolerated dose (MTD). The best correlation was observed for rat AUC(ss,u) at the 
      MTD (p < 0.001). E(max) model analysis was performed using the efficacy of each 
      drug in xenograft mice, and the efficacy at the human AUC of the clinical dose 
      was evaluated. The predicted efficacy at the human AUC of the clinical dose 
      varied from far below E(max) to around E(max) even in the tumor for which use of 
      the drugs had been accepted. These results suggest that rat AUC(ss,u) at the MTD, 
      but not the efficacy in xenograft mice, may be a useful parameter to estimate the 
      human clinical dose of kinase inhibitors, which seems to be currently determined 
      by toxicity rather than efficacy.

TI  - An internally validated new clinical and inflammation-based prognostic score for 
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated with sorafenib.
PG  - 322-329

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib is a standard treatment for patients (pts) with advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC), although the clinical benefit is heterogeneous 
      between different pts groups. Among novel prognostic factors, a low baseline 
      neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (bNLR) and early-onset diarrhoea have been linked 
      with a better prognosis. PURPOSE: To identify prognostic factors in pts with aHCC 
      treated with 1st-line sorafenib and to develop a new prognostic score to guide 
      management. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 145 pts bNLR, overall 
      toxicity, early toxicity rates and overall survival (OS) were assessed. 
      Univariate and multivariate analysis of prognostic factors for OS was performed. 
      The prognostic score was calculated from the coefficients found in the Cox 
      analysis. ROC curves and pseudoR2 index were used for internal validation. 
      Discrimination ability and calibration were tested by Harrel's c-index (HCI) and 
      Akaike criteria (AIC). RESULTS: The optimal bNLR cut-off for the prediction of OS 
      was 4 (AUC 0.62). Independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis for OS 
      were performance status (PS) (p < .0001), Child-Pugh (C-P) score (p = 0.005), 
      early-onset diarrhoea (p = 0.006) and BNLR (0.011). The prognostic score based on 
      these four variables was found efficient (HCI = 0.659; AIC = 1.180). Four risk 
      groups for OS could be identified: a very low-risk (median OS = 48.6 months), a 
      low-risk (median OS = 11.6 months), an intermediate-risk (median OS = 8.3 months) 
      and a high-risk group (median OS = 4.4 months). CONCLUSIONS: PS and C-P score 
      were the main prognostic factors for OS, followed by early-onset diarrhoea and 
      bNLR. We identified four risk groups for OS depending on these parameters. This 
      prognostic model could be useful for patient stratification, but an external 
      validation is needed.

TI  - An investigation into possible interactions among four vascular epidermal growth 
      factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors with gefitinib.
PG  - 43-52
LID - 10.1007/s00280-020-04191-0 [doi]
AB  - The objective of present work is to evaluate possible interactions among four 
      clinically-used vascular epidermal growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors (TKIs), including apatinib, cabozantinib, sorafenib, and sunitinib, 
      with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-TKI gefitinib. This may advance 
      knowledge regarding possible dual-target suppression strategies for advanced 
      NSCLC, including VEGFR-TKI plus EGFR-TKI. The in vitro metabolism study 
      demonstrated that apatinib inhibited the formation of metabolite M537194 with 
      moderate effect, and inhibited another metabolite formation of M523595 with 
      strong effect, in both human and rat liver microsomes. Sorafenib, cabozantinib, 
      and sunitinib had no significant inhibitory effect on gefitinib metabolism. The 
      results of the in vivo pharmacokinetics study were consistent with the in vitro 
      metabolism study: the AUC(0-t), AUC(0-∞) and C(max) of gefitinib increased 
      significantly when co-administered with apatinib by 26.8, 28.7, and 19.8%, 
      respectively. Cabozantinib, sorafenib, and sunitinib exhibited no effect on 
      gefitinib pharmacokinetics. Molecular docking was applied to investigate the 
      binding mode between TKIs and CYP2D6. The docking results illustrated that 
      binding characteristics of apatinib and gefitinib with CYP2D6 were similar, which 
      accounts for competitive mechanism of apatinib-inhibited gefitinib metabolism. In 
      summary, apatinib inhibited the metabolism of gefitinib in vitro and in vivo that 
      were mediated by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. In addition, cabozantinib, sorafenib, and 
      sunitinib expressed no interaction with gefitinib. The results of the present 
      study may provide a basis and valuable information for the development of 
      treatment strategies.

TI  - Survival Estimates after Stopping Sorafenib in Patients with Hepatocellular 
      Carcinoma: NEXT Score Development and Validation.
PG  - 693-701
LID - 10.5009/gnl16391 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Limited information is available regarding patient survival 
      after sorafenib discontinuation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
      Thus, we developed and validated a novel survival prediction model. METHODS: 
      Clinical data from 409 patients with HCC who stopped taking sorafenib between 
      September 2008 and February 2015 were reviewed. RESULTS: In the training cohort, 
      four factors were independent negative predictors of survival (p<0.05). Based on 
      the β regression coefficient of each factor, we established the NEXT score 
      (Survival after Stopping Nexavar Treatment), allocating 1 point each for an 
      Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score ≥2, Child-Pugh class B or C, serum 
      sodium ≤135 mEq/L, and α-fetoprotein 〉400 ng/mL. Area under the receiver 
      operating characteristic curve values to predict 1-, 3-, and 6-month survival 
      rates were 0.805, 0.809, and 0.774, respectively, in the training cohort and 
      0.783, 0.728, and 0.673, respectively, in the validation cohort (n=137). When the 
      training and validation cohorts were stratified into three risk groups (NEXT 
      score 0 [low-risk] vs 1 to 2 [intermediate-risk] vs 3 to 4 [high-risk]), survival 
      differed significantly between the groups (p＜0.05, log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: 
      In patients with HCC, survival after stopping sorafenib is poor. However, risk 
      estimates based on a new "NEXT score" may help predict survival and prognosis 
      even in patients who discontinue sorafenib treatment.

AB  - Guided by the pharmacophoric features of both EGFR and VEGFR-2 antagonists, two 
      novel series of 4-methoxyphenyl pyrazole and pyrimidine derivatives [(4a-c) and 
      (5a-c, 6, 7a-c, 8, 9, 10, 11a,c, 12, 13a-c, 14a-c, and 15a,b)], respectively, 
      were designed and synthesized as dual EGFR/VEGFR-2 inhibitors. Interestingly, 
      compound 12 showed very strong antiproliferative effects towards all the five 
      studied cell lines (HepG-2, MCF-7, MDA-231, HCT-116, and Caco-2) with IC(50) 
      values of 3.74, 7.81, 4.85, 2.96, and 9.27 µM, respectively. Also, it achieved 
      the highest inhibitory activities against both EGFR and VEGFR-2 as well 
      (IC(50) = 0.071 and 0.098 µM) compared to the two reference drugs, erlotinib 
      (IC(50) = 0.063 µM) and sorafenib (IC(50) = 0.041 µM), respectively. Moreover, 
      four compounds (4a, 7a, 7c, and 12) were selected for further evaluation through 
      cell cycle analysis and Annexin V-based flow cytometry assay in the HepG-2 cell 
      line. In addition, deep computational studies including molecular docking, 
      physicochemical properties, profiling pharmacokinetics, ADMET studies, and 
      toxicity predictions were performed for the designed compounds to evaluate the 
      prospective drug candidates. Finally, analyzing the structure-activity 
      relationship (SAR) of the new derivatives gives us a lot of interesting promising 
      results which could help medicinal chemists to design more potent drug candidates 
      soon as well.

AB  - Since the discovery of the remarkable efficacy of imatinib in the metastatic 
      GIST, several studies advanced our knowledge on the care of this pathology. In 
      the localized GIST, the efficacy of the adjuvant treatment by imatinib was 
      proved, but the duration, the indication and the management in case of relapse 
      after imatinib are not still consensual. The imatinib is also used in neoadjuvant 
      setting to optimize the quality of resection, the main treatment remaining the 
      maximal tumor resection. In metastatic setting, imatinib remains the standard of 
      care first-line treatment. It must be administered until progress or intolerance. 
      Nevertheless, secondary resistance to imatinib is a substantial problem in 
      routine clinical practice; in second line, sunitinib demonstrated its efficacy. 
      Several inhibitors of tyrosine-kinases are ongoing evaluated in all the 
      therapeutic lines. Clearly, a better knowledge of the molecular profile and the 
      pharmacokinetics underlying the resistance to imatinib as well as the development 
      of a new class of broad-spectrum tyrosine-kinase inhibitors may allow in the near 
      future new individualized therapeutic strategies for GIST patients.

TI  - A phase I dose-escalation study to evaluate safety and tolerability of sorafenib 
      combined with sirolimus in patients with advanced solid cancer.
PG  - 1637-43
LID - 10.1038/sj.bjc.6605777 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination of sorafenib (vascular endothelial growth factor 
      receptor 2 inhibitor) and sirolimus (mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor) 
      might work synergistically. METHODS: A phase I dose-escalation study with 
      sorafenib twice a day (b.i.d.) and sirolimus once daily (q.d.) was performed to 
      determine the recommended dose of the combination in patients with solid tumours. 
      Secondary objectives were to determine the safety profile and maximum tolerated 
      dose (MTD), and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the combination. 
      RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicities were transaminitis and cutaneous toxicity. The 
      most frequently reported adverse events were elevated transaminases, 
      hypophosphatemia, fatigue, anorexia, diarrhoea, nausea, rash and palmar-plantar 
      erythrodysaesthesia. Sirolimus did not change the PK of sorafenib; in contrast, 
      sorafenib reduced the AUC(0-96) and C(max) of sirolimus. No objective responses 
      were observed; eight patients showed stable disease for a median of 16.3 weeks 
      (range 8-24). The MTD of the combination was sorafenib 200  mg b.i.d. with 
      sirolimus 1 mg q.d. CONCLUSION: The combination of sorafenib and sirolimus showed 
      enhanced toxicity, which could not be explained by the PK of both drugs. The 
      relative low doses at the MTD, in combination with the PK results, do not warrant 
      further development of this combination.

PG  - 2255-7
AB  - The drug design and discovery efforts described in the previous section led to 
      the development of a novel, small molecule Raf-1 kinase inhibitor, BAY 43-9006, 
      which belongs to a class that can be broadly described as bis-aryl ureas (Figure 
      1). BAY 43-9006 was identified during a large medicinal chemistry optimization 
      program, and this compound was selected for further pharmacological 
      characterization based on its potent inhibition of Raf-1 (IC(50) 12 nM) and its 
      favorable kinase selectivity profile. In vitro and in vivo experiments were 
      designed to demonstrate effective blockade of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling pathway 
      in tumor cells and for anti tumor efficacy in human xenograft models.

TI  - Supersaturated LFCS type III self-emulsifying delivery systems of sorafenib 
      tosylate with improved biopharmaceutical performance: QbD-enabled development and 
      evaluation.
PG  - 839-861
LID - 10.1007/s13346-020-00772-x [doi]
AB  - The current studies investigate the application of quality by design-enabled type 
      III self-emulsifying delivery system (Type III-SEDDS) of sorafenib tosylate (SFN) 
      in improving its biopharmaceutical attributes. Initially, lipidic and emulsifying 
      excipients were selected by carrying out solubility and phase titration 
      experiments. After screening studies using Taguchi OA design, Type III-SEDDS were 
      further optimised using D-optimal mixture design. The prepared formulations were 
      assessed for globule size, zeta potential and percent of drug release. Following 
      graphical optimisation, the optimum formulation was earmarked and further 
      supersaturated to form saturated Type III-SEDDS (Sat-Type III-SEDDS) using a 
      combination of HPMC and PVP to improve the stability of the formulation for a 
      prolonged period. In vitro drug release of Type III-SEDDS study indicated 
      approximately 8-fold improvement in dissolution rate over the pure powder drug. 
      Cell uptake studies demonstrated higher uptake of dye-loaded Type III-SEDDS 
      formulations in Caco-2 cells vis-à-vis plain dye. Cytotoxicity assay on Hep G2 
      cells revealed significant reduction in cell growth with Type III- and Sat-Type 
      III-SEDDS vis-à-vis the pure drug. Furthermore, in situ permeation studies 
      carried out using Wistar rats exhibited nearly 8.3- to 10.2-fold augmentation in 
      permeation and absorption parameters of the drug from the Type III- and Sat-Type 
      III-SEDDS, respectively, vis-à-vis the pure drug. Pharmacokinetic studies 
      indicated nearly 3.98- and 3.62-fold improvement in AUC(0-72), and 8.01- and 
      5.42-fold in C(max), along with 0.25-fold decrease in T(max) of the drug from 
      Type III- and Sat-Type III-SEDDS, respectively, in comparison with the SFN 
      suspension. Furthermore, high degree of level A linear correlation was 
      established between fractions of drug dissolved (in vitro) and of drug absorbed 
      (in vivo) at the corresponding time points for Sat-Type III-SEDDS and pure drug, 
      whereas the Type III-SEDDS exhibited a nonlinear relationship. Stability studies 
      indicated the robustness of Sat-Type III-SEDDS, when stored at 25 °C for 
      3 months. Overall, the manuscript documents the successful systematic development 
      of SFN-loaded Sat-Type III-SEDDS with distinctly improved biopharmaceutical 
      performance. Graphical abstract.

AB  - Molecular-targeted therapies with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have provided 
      a major breakthrough in cancer treatment. These agents are given orally and 
      demonstrated to be substrates for drug transporters. In clinical settings, TKIs 
      are mainly used at a fixed dose, but wide interpatient variability has been 
      observed in their pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics. Genetic polymorphisms 
      of ABC transporters, drug-drug interaction and adherence are among the factors 
      causing such variation. To overcome these problems, therapeutic drug monitoring 
      has been applied in clinical practice for patient care. Skin disorders are 
      frequently observed as adverse drug reactions when using TKIs, and are commonly 
      managed by symptomatic therapy based on clinical experience. Recent studies have 
      provided some insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying skin disorders 
      induced by TKIs. This review article summarizes the accumulated clinical and 
      basic pharmacological evidence of TKIs, focusing on erlotinib, sorafenib and 
      sunitinib.

AB  - Drug interactions are an on-going concern in the treatment of cancer, especially 
      when targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) or mammalian 
      target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, are being used. The emergence of elderly 
      patients and/or patients with both cancer and other chronic co-morbidities leads 
      to polypharmacy. Therefore, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI) becomes a 
      clinically relevant issue, all the more so as TKIs and mTOR inhibitors are 
      essentially metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes. These DDIs can result in 
      variability in anticancer drug exposure, thus favouring the selection of 
      resistant cellular clones or the occurrence of toxicity. This review provides a 
      comprehensive overview of DDIs that involve targeted therapies approved by the 
      FDA for the treatment of solid tumours for more than 3 years (sorafenib, 
      sunitinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, imatinib, lapatinib, everolimus, temsirolimus) 
      and medicinal herb or drugs. This review also provides some guidelines to help 
      oncologists and pharmacists in their clinical practice.

TI  - Phase I trial of sorafenib in combination with IFN alpha-2a in patients with 
      unresectable and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma or malignant melanoma.
PG  - 1801-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics, and 
      efficacy, and to evaluate biomarkers, of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib plus 
      IFN alpha-2a in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) or melanoma. EXPERIMENTAL 
      DESIGN: Patients received 28-day cycles of continuous, oral sorafenib twice daily 
      and s.c. IFN thrice weekly: sorafenib 200 mg twice daily plus IFN 6 million IU 
      (MIU) thrice weekly (cohort 1); and sorafenib 400 mg twice daily plus IFN 6 MIU 
      thrice weekly (cohort 2); or plus IFN 9 MIU thrice weekly (cohort 3). Tumor 
      response was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and dynamic 
      contrast-enhanced ultrasonography. RESULTS: Thirteen patients received at least 
      one dose of sorafenib plus IFN (12 RCC; one melanoma). The maximum tolerated dose 
      was not reached [only one dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 asthenia)]. Most 
      frequently reported drug-related adverse events were grade 2 or less in severity, 
      including fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, and hand-foot skin reaction. One 
      (7.7%) RCC patient achieved partial response and eight (61.5%) had stable disease 
      (including the melanoma patient). Good responders assessed by dynamic 
      contrast-enhanced ultrasonography had increased progression-free survival and 
      overall survival, relative to poor responders. IFN had no effect on the 
      pharmacokinetics of sorafenib. There were no significant changes in absolute 
      values of lymphocytes, levels of proangiogenic cytokines, or inhibition of 
      phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase in T cells or natural killer 
      cells, with combination therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This sorafenib combination was well 
      tolerated, with preliminary antitumor activity in advanced RCC and melanoma 
      patients. There were no drug-drug interactions and the recommended dose for 
      future studies is sorafenib 400 mg twice daily plus IFN 9 MIU.

TI  - [Simultaneous determination of donafenib and its N-oxide metabolite in human 
      plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry].
PG  - 443-8
AB  - Donafenib is the deuterium derivative of sorafenib, and is an anti-tumor drug in 
      clinical trials. An accurate and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the simultaneous 
      determination of donafenib and its N-oxide metabolite in human plasma. The 
      analytes and internal standards (sorafenib and sorafenib N-oxide) were extracted 
      from plasma by protein precipitation with acetonitrile, and separated on a Gemini 
      C18 (50 mm × 2.0 mm, 5 μm) column using a gradient elution procedure. The mobile 
      phase consisted of acetonitrile and 5 mmol ·L−1 ammonium acetate (0.2% formic 
      acid) at a flow rate of 0.7 mL·min−1. The total run time was 5.0 min. Positive 
      electrospray ionization was performed using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) 
      with transitions of m/z 468.2 → 273.2 for donafenib and m/z 465.2 → 270.2 for its 
      internal standard sorafenib, m/z 484.2 → 289.2 for donafenib N-oxide and m/z 
      481.2 → 286.2 for its internal standard sorafenib N-oxide. The standard curves 
      were linear in the range of 5.00−5 000 ng·mL−1 for donafenib, and 1.00−1 000 
      ng·mL−1 for donafenib N-oxide. The method was validated and successfully applied 
      to the pharmacokinetics study of donafenib tosylate tablets in volunteers.

PG  - 12802-12824
LID - 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.2c00631 [doi]
AB  - Ligand-targeting drug delivery systems have made significant strides for disease 
      treatments with numerous clinical approvals in this era of precision medicine. 
      Herein, we report a class of small molecule-based immune checkpoint-targeting 
      maytansinoid conjugates. From the ligand targeting ability, pharmacokinetics 
      profiling, in vivo anti-pancreatic cancer, triple-negative breast cancer, and 
      sorafenib-resistant liver cancer efficacies with quantitative mRNA analysis of 
      treated-tumor tissues, we demonstrated that conjugate 40a not only induced 
      lasting regression of tumor growth, but it also rejuvenated the once 
      immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to an "inflamed hot tumor" with 
      significant elevation of gene expressions that were not accessible in the 
      vehicle-treated tumor. In turn, the immune checkpoint-targeting small molecule 
      drug conjugate from this work represents a new pharmacodelivery strategy that can 
      be expanded with combination therapy with existing immune-oncology treatment 
      options.

TI  - Phase I study of sorafenib combined with radiation therapy and temozolomide as 
      first-line treatment of high-grade glioma.
PG  - 2655-61
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2014.209 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib (Sb) is a multiple kinase inhibitor targeting both tumour 
      cell proliferation and angiogenesis that may further act as a potent 
      radiosensitizer by arresting cells in the most radiosensitive cell cycle phase. 
      This phase I open-label, noncontrolled dose escalation study was performed to 
      determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Sb in combination with 
      radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) in 17 patients with newly diagnosed 
      high-grade glioma. METHODS: Patients were treated with RT (60 Gy in 2 Gy 
      fractions) combined with TMZ 75 mg m(-2) daily, and Sb administered at three dose 
      levels (200 mg daily, 200 mg BID, and 400 mg BID) starting on day 8 of RT. Thirty 
      days after the end of RT, patients received monthly TMZ (150-200 mg m(-2) 
      D1-5/28) and Sb (400 mg BID). Pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses were performed on day 
      8 (TMZ) and on day 21 (TMZ&Sb) (Clinicaltrials ID: NCT00884416). RESULTS: The MTD 
      of Sb was established at 200 mg BID. Dose-limiting toxicities included 
      thrombocytopenia (two patients), diarrhoea (one patient) and 
      hypercholesterolaemia (one patient). Sb administration did not affect the mean 
      area under the curve(0-24) and mean Cmax of TMZ and its metabolite 
      5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC). Tmax of both TMZ and AIC was delayed from 
      0.75 (TMZ alone) to 1.5 h (combined TMZ/Sb). The median progression-free survival 
      was 7.9 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 5.4-14.55), and the median overall 
      survival was 17.8 months (95% CI: 14.7-25.6). CONCLUSIONS: Although Sb can be 
      combined with RT and TMZ, significant side effects and moderate outcome results 
      do not support further clinical development in malignant gliomas. The robust PK 
      data of the TMZ/Sb combination could be useful in other cancer settings.

TI  - The use of lipid-coated nanodiamond to improve bioavailability and efficacy of 
      sorafenib in resisting metastasis of gastric cancer.

AB  - The metastasis is one of the greatest challenges for successful cancer therapy. 
      Herein, we report a lipid-coated nanodiamond (ND) system loading water-insoluble 
      sorafenib (SND) to improve the bioavailability and efficacy on suppression of 
      cancer metastasis. SND was homogenous nanoassemblies with the mean diameter of 
      127.6 ± 12.9 nm. Compared with the drug suspension, the sorafenib concentration 
      in gastrointestinal (GI) tract and major organs was significantly increased by 
      SND. Moreover, the oral bioavailability of sorafenib was greatly improved 
      7.64-fold by SND. However, the ND in SND could not be absorbed into the mucus of 
      GI tract or distributed into major organs after oral administration. Furthermore, 
      the sorafenib concentration in tumor tissue was markedly improved 14.95 folds by 
      SND, and SND demonstrated an efficient and impressive tumor growth inhibition 
      effect in tumor xenograft models. In particular, the metastasis of gastric cancer 
      to distant organs of liver and kidney was remarkably suppressed by SND, which was 
      verified by the detection of macroscopic metastatic nodules, histological 
      examination and immunofluorescence measurements. Thereby, the lipid-coated ND 
      could be a promising drug delivery platform for improving the oral 
      bioavailability of lipophilic drugs and treatment of cancer metastasis.

AB  - Nanoformulations of therapeutic drugs are transforming our ability to effectively 
      deliver and treat a myriad of conditions. Often, however, they are complex to 
      produce and exhibit low drug loading, except for nanoparticles formed via 
      co-assembly of drugs and small molecular dyes, which display drug-loading 
      capacities of up to 95%. There is currently no understanding of which of the 
      millions of small-molecule combinations can result in the formation of these 
      nanoparticles. Here we report the integration of machine learning with 
      high-throughput experimentation to enable the rapid and large-scale 
      identification of such nanoformulations. We identified 100 self-assembling drug 
      nanoparticles from 2.1 million pairings, each including one of 788 candidate 
      drugs and one of 2,686 approved excipients. We further characterized two 
      nanoparticles, sorafenib-glycyrrhizin and terbinafine-taurocholic acid both ex 
      vivo and in vivo. We anticipate that our platform can accelerate the development 
      of safer and more efficacious nanoformulations with high drug-loading capacities 
      for a wide range of therapeutics.

TI  - NABTT 0502: a phase II and pharmacokinetic study of erlotinib and sorafenib for 
      patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.
PG  - 490-6
LID - 10.1093/neuonc/nos322 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The signal transduction pathways of epidermal growth factor receptor 
      and Ras are both important in the growth of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We 
      hypothesized that inhibition of both pathways would improve the survival time of 
      patients with recurrent GBM. METHODS: Patients with recurrent/progressive GBM 
      with 0-2 prior chemotherapy regimens received erlotinib 150 mg once daily and 
      sorafenib 400 mg twice daily until progression. The primary endpoint was overall 
      survival. Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed during cycle 1. RESULTS: The 
      median overall survival was 5.7 months. Progression-free survival at 6 months was 
      14%. Toxicity was manageable. Clearance of erlotinib was markedly enhanced by 
      sorafenib. CONCLUSION: The study did not meet its objective of a 30% increase in 
      overall survival time compared with historical controls. Erlotinib and sorafenib 
      have significant pharmacokinetic interactions that may negatively impact the 
      efficacy of the combination regimen.

TI  - Temsirolimus combined with sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma: a phase I 
      dose-finding trial with pharmacokinetic and biomarker correlates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Based upon preclinical evidence for improved antitumor activity in 
      combination, this phase I study investigated the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), 
      safety, activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), and biomarkers of the mammalian target 
      of rapamycin inhibitor, temsirolimus, combined with sorafenib in hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with incurable HCC and Child Pugh 
      score ≤B7 were treated with sorafenib plus temsirolimus by 3 + 3 design. The 
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) interval was 28 days. The response was assessed 
      every two cycles. PK of temsirolimus was measured in a cohort at MTD. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-five patients were enrolled. The MTD was temsirolimus 10 mg weekly plus 
      sorafenib 200 mg twice daily. Among 18 patients at MTD, DLT included grade 3 
      hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Grade 3 or 4 related 
      adverse events at MTD included hypophosphatemia (33%), infection (22%), 
      thrombocytopenia (17%), HFSR (11%), and fatigue (11%). With sorafenib, 
      temsirolimus clearance was more rapid (P < 0.05). Two patients (8%) had a 
      confirmed partial response (PR); 15 (60%) had stable disease (SD). 
      Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) declined ≥50% in 60% assessable patients. CONCLUSION: The 
      MTD of sorafenib plus temsirolimus in HCC was lower than in other tumor types. 
      HCC-specific phase I studies are necessary. The observed efficacy warrants 
      further study.

TI  - Tivozanib for the treatment of metastatic renal cancer.
PG  - 649-60
LID - 10.1586/era.13.40 [doi]
AB  - Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic renal 
      cell carcinoma (RCC). Drugs such as sorafenib, sunitinib and pazopanib act on the 
      VEGF receptor pathway, but they can also inhibit other kinases, resulting in 
      off-target toxicities. Tivozanib was developed due to its potency and selectivity 
      against VEGF receptors 1-3. It has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile after oral 
      administration and a long plasma half-life. In the Phase III TIVO-1 trial, it 
      demonstrated a higher response rate and longer progression-free survival than 
      sorafenib with a better side-effect profile. It is currently awaiting approval to 
      be used in the first-line treatment of metastatic RCC. An early-phase trial has 
      also shown its tolerability at full dose when given with the mTOR inhibitor 
      temsirolimus, suggesting its potential in combination treatment. This article 
      examines tivozanib from its laboratory to clinical development, as well as its 
      relevance and future role in the treatment of RCC in the era of the tyrosine 
      kinase inhibitors.

      needs some additional care. Normally Sorafenib tosylate 200 mg is recommended for 
      liver cancer. There is no such trial in which this drug could effectively be used 
      in combination of direct acting antivirals for HCV. The study was conducted for 
      HCV patients (n=30) with liver cancer having decompensated stage. Combination of 
      Sorafenib tosylate, Ribavirn and Sofosbuvir were used for the pharmacokinetics of 
      these medicines. Child pugh score less then 7 (CP A) in adults during treatment 
      phase (received 12 weeks of Sorafenib tosylate 200 mg, Ribavirn and Sofosbuvir 
      400 mg once daily) have no side effect while child pugh score 7-9 (CP B) have 
      evidence of hypertension. The main efficiency end point sustained virology 
      response with overcoming liver cancer as well in 12 weeks after end treatment 
      (SVR-LLC 12). Mean pharmacokinetic exposure to Sorafenib tosylate 200 mg, 
      Ribavirn and Sofosbuvir at week 8th was 2.1, 1.5,1.2 times greater in CP B than 
      in CP A. Adverse effects (AEs) were observed in 12 out of 30 patients but not 
      severe as lethal for life. Treatment with Sorafenib tosylate, Ribavirn and 
      Sofosbuvir for twelve weeks was harmless and well accepted, 100 % patients 
      achieve (SVR LLC 12) with 10-fold cure rate more than previous ones. The 
      combination therapy of Sorafenib tosylate, Ribavirn and Sofosbuvir was found 
      helpful for the management of decompensated liver cancer.

AB  - Embolic microspheres or beads used in transarterial chemoembolization are an 
      established treatment method for hepatocellular carcinoma patients. The occlusion 
      of the tumor-feeding vessels by intra-arterial injection of the beads results in 
      tumor necrosis and shrinkage. In this short review, we describe the utility of 
      using these beads as devices for local drug delivery. We review the latest 
      advances in the development of non-biodegradable and biodegradable drug-eluting 
      beads for transarterial chemoembolization. Their capability to load different 
      drugs, such as chemotherapeutics and anti-angiogenic compounds with different 
      physicochemical properties, like charge and hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, are 
      discussed. We specifically address controlled and sustained drug release from the 
      microspheres, and the resulting in vivo pharmacokinetics in the plasma vs. drug 
      distribution in the targeted tissue.

TI  - Stearoyl-CoA desaturase regulates sorafenib resistance via modulation of ER 
      stress-induced differentiation.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We investigated the functional role and clinical significance 
      of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in 
      regulating liver tumor-initiating cells (T-ICs) and sorafenib resistance, with 
      the aim of developing a novel therapeutic strategy against hepatocellular 
      carcinomas (HCCs). METHODS: We evaluated the clinic-pathological relevance of 
      SCD1 and its correlation with sorafenib resistance in large cohorts of HCC 
      clinical samples by qPCR and immunohistochemical analyses. Lentiviral-based 
      overexpression and knockdown approaches were performed to characterize the 
      functional roles of SCD1 in regulating liver T-ICs and sorafenib resistance. 
      Molecular pathways mediating the phenotypic alterations were identified through 
      RNA sequencing analysis and functional rescue experiments. The combinatorial 
      effect of SCD1 inhibition and sorafenib was tested using a patient-derived tumor 
      xenograft (PDTX) model. RESULTS: SCD1 overexpression was found in HCC, which was 
      associated with shorter disease-free survival (p = 0.008, log rank test). SCD1 
      was found to regulate the populations of liver T-ICs; while its suppression by a 
      SCD1 inhibitor suppressed liver T-ICs and sorafenib resistance. Interestingly, 
      SCD1 was markedly upregulated in our established sorafenib-resistant PDTX model, 
      and its overexpression predicts the clinical response of HCC patients to 
      sorafenib treatment. Suppression of SCD1 forces liver T-ICs to differentiate via 
      ER stress-induced unfolded protein response, resulting in an enhanced sensitivity 
      to sorafenib. The PDTX#1 model, combined with sorafenib treatment and a novel 
      SCD1 inhibitor (SSI-4), showed a maximal growth suppressive effect. CONCLUSIONS: 
      SCD1-mediated ER stress regulates liver T-ICs and sorafenib sensitivity. 
      Targeting SCD1 alone or in combination with sorafenib might be a novel 
      personalized medicine against HCC. Lay summary: In this study, SCD1 was found to 
      play a critical role in regulating liver tumor-initiating cells and sorafenib 
      resistance through the regulation of ER stress-mediated differentiation. 
      Targeting SCD1 in combination with sorafenib may be a novel therapeutic strategy 
      against liver cancer.

AB  - Most of oral targeted therapies are tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Oral 
      administration generates a complex step in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of these 
      drugs. Inter-individual PK variability is often large and variability observed in 
      response is influenced not only by the genetic heterogeneity of drug targets, but 
      also by the pharmacogenetic background of the patient (e.g. cytochome P450 and 
      ABC transporter polymorphisms), patient characteristics such as adherence to 
      treatment and environmental factors (drug-drug interactions). Retrospective 
      studies have shown that targeted drug exposure, reflected in the area under the 
      plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) correlates with treatment response 
      (efficacy/toxicity) in various cancers. Nevertheless levels of evidence for 
      therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) are however heterogeneous among these agents 
      and TDM is still uncommon for the majority of them. Evidence for imatinib 
      currently exists, others are emerging for compounds including nilotinib, 
      dasatinib, erlotinib, sunitinib, sorafenib and mammalian target of rapamycin 
      (mTOR) inhibitors. Applications for TDM during oral targeted therapies may best 
      be reserved for particular situations including lack of therapeutic response, 
      severe or unexpected toxicities, anticipated drug-drug interactions and/or 
      concerns over adherence treatment. Interpatient PK variability observed with 
      monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is comparable or slightly lower to that observed 
      with TKIs. There are still few data with these agents in favour of TDM 
      approaches, even if data showed encouraging results with rituximab, cetuximab and 
      bevacizumab. At this time, TDM of mAbs is not yet supported by scientific 
      evidence. Considerable effort should be made for targeted therapies to better 
      define concentration-effect relationships and to perform comparative randomised 
      trials of classic dosing versus pharmacokinetically-guided adaptive dosing.

TI  - Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers predict survival 
      and response in hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with sorafenib and 
      metronomic tegafur/uracil.
PG  - 858-65
LID - 10.1016/j.jhep.2011.01.032 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sorafenib plus metronomic tegafur/uracil therapy can induce 
      tumor stabilization in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. This 
      study evaluated the correlation of vascular response measured by dynamic 
      contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) and the clinical outcome. 
      METHODS: DCE-MRI was performed in advanced HCC patients treated with sorafenib 
      (800 mg/d) plus tegafur/uracil (250 mg/m(2)/d based on tegafur) at baseline and 
      after 14 days of treatment. An operator-defined region of interest was placed in 
      the most strongly enhanced area of the tumor to measure the pharmacokinetic 
      parameter K(trans). Changes in K(trans) after treatment were correlated with the 
      best tumor response and survival. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were evaluable. 
      There were one partial response (PR), 18 stable disease (SD), and 12 progressive 
      disease (PD) according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
      (RECIST). Baseline K(trans) was higher in patients with PR or SD (median 1215.2 × 
      10(-3)/min, range 582.5-4555.3 × 10(-3)/min) than patients with PD (median 702.0 
      × 10(-3)/min, range 375.2-1938.0 × 10(-3)/min, p = 0.008). After 14 days of study 
      treatment, the median K(trans) change was -47.1% (range -87.0 to -18.0%) in 
      patients with PR or SD, and 9.6% (range -44.8 to +81%) in those with PD 
      (p<0.001). A vascular response, defined by a 40% or greater decrease in K(trans) 
      after 14 days of study treatment, correlated with longer progression-free 
      survival (median 29.1 vs. 8.7 weeks, p = 0.033) and overall survival (median 53.0 
      vs. 14.9 weeks, p = 0.016). Percentage of K(trans) change after treatment is an 
      independent predictor of tumor response, progression-free survival, and overall 
      survival. CONCLUSIONS: K(trans) measured by DCE-MRI correlated well with tumor 
      response and survival in HCC patients who received sorafenib plus metronomic 
      tegafur/uracil therapy.

TI  - Safety and pharmacokinetics of the dual action Raf kinase and vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor, BAY 43-9006, in patients with 
      advanced, refractory solid tumors.
PG  - 5472-80
AB  - PURPOSE: BAY 43-9006, a novel multikinase inhibitor, prevents tumor growth by 
      combining two antitumor activities: inhibition of both tumor cell proliferation 
      and tumor angiogenesis. This phase I, open-label, nonrandomized, noncontrolled, 
      single-arm, dose escalation study was done to determine the maximum tolerated 
      dose (MTD), safety profile, pharmacokinetic variables, effect on biomarkers, and 
      tumor response with BAY 43-9006 in 19 patients with advanced, refractory solid 
      tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: BAY 43-9006 was given orally in repeated cycles of 
      1-week on/1-week off. The study comprised five dose levels, ranging from 100 mg 
      twice daily (bid) to 800 mg bid. Treatment of each patient continued until 
      unacceptable toxicity, tumor progression, or death. RESULTS: Rash and 
      hypertension were the dose-limiting toxicities at the 800 mg bid dose requiring 
      study drug discontinuation; therefore, the MTD of BAY 43-9006 in this study was 
      determined to be 600 mg bid. BAY 43-9006 was generally well tolerated, with mild 
      to moderate toxicities. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed early absorption followed 
      by delayed secondary peaks and slow terminal elimination. Stable disease was 
      achieved in five patients: one patient showed reduced tumor activity (positron 
      emission tomography scan) and reduced mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling 
      (lower phospho-ERK); one patient remained on treatment until study end point. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the favorable safety profile of BAY 43-9006 and 
      support the development of this compound for the treatment of solid tumors.

TI  - PDGF receptors as targets in tumor treatment.
PG  - 247-74
AB  - Signaling through platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors contributes to 
      multiple tumor-associated processes. The recent introduction of clinically useful 
      PDGF inhibitors have the last years validated PDGF receptors in malignant and 
      stromal cells as relevant cancer drug targets. Mutational activation of PDGF 
      receptor signaling in malignant cells has been described in some rare tumor types 
      such as dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, a subset of GISTs, and some hematologic 
      malignancies. Furthermore, expression of PDGF receptors on pericytes is a common 
      characteristic of solid tumors. The clinical efficacy of novel multikinase 
      inhibitors, such as sunitinib and sorafenib, most likely involves targeting of 
      PDGF receptor-dependent pericytes. Preclinical studies suggest that targeting of 
      stromal PDGF receptors might also constitute a novel strategy to enhance tumor 
      drug uptake. Finally, recent studies have implied both pro- and antimetastatic 
      effects of PDGF receptors on malignant and stromal cells. The studies on the 
      roles of PDGF receptors in cancer signaling are thus presently in a dynamic phase 
      where collaborations between oncologists, pathologists, and tumor biologists are 
      predicted to be highly productive.

TI  - Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006): review of clinical development.
PG  - 223-8
AB  - Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) is a novel oral bis-aryl urea compound originally 
      developed as an inhibitor to RAF kinase for its anti-proliferative property. It 
      also inhibits receptor tyrosine kinases of multiple pro-angiogenic factors such 
      as VEGFR-2/3, Flt-3/ and PDGFR-beta. The combination of both its 
      anti-proliferative and anti-angiogenic properties makes sorafenib an attractive 
      agent in cancer treatment. Phase I studies demonstrated that sorafenib was well 
      tolerated, and the recommended phase II dose was 400 mg twice daily continuously. 
      Common toxicities included skin toxicity (rash and hand-foot syndrome), 
      gastrointestinal toxicities (nausea and diarrhea) and fatigue. Anti-tumor 
      activities were observed in multiple tumors types including renal cell carcinoma 
      and hepatocellular carcinoma. Randomized phase III studies in these tumor types 
      are ongoing, and results are eagerly waited.

TI  - Hepatocellular carcinoma treated with sorafenib: early detection of treatment 
      response and major adverse events by contrast-enhanced US.
PG  - 605-15
LID - 10.1111/liv.12098 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Early prediction of tumour response and major adverse events 
      (AEs), especially liver failure, in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
      is essential for maximizing the clinical benefits of sorafenib. To evaluate the 
      usefulness of dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (DCE-US) for the early 
      prediction of tumour response and major AEs in HCC patients. METHODS: 
      Thirty-seven HCC patients were started on a reduced dosage of sorafenib, 
      subsequently increased to the standard dosage. Tumour response at 1 month was 
      assessed by CT using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). 
      Major AEs were defined as grade 3 or higher. DCE-US was performed before 
      treatment (day 0) and on days 7, 14 and 28. Changes in perfusion parameters in 
      the tumour and liver parenchyma between day 0 and later time points were compared 
      between treatment responders and nonresponders based on RECIST and between 
      patients who experienced major AEs and those who did not. Tumour results were 
      also compared with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). 
      RESULTS: Tumour perfusion parameters based on the area under the time-intensity 
      curve (AUC) were statistically significant, with AUC during washin on day 14, the 
      most relevant for tumour response (P = 0.0016) and AUC during washin on day 7, 
      the most relevant for both PFS (P = 0.009) and OS (P = 0.037). A decrease in 
      total AUC between days 0 and 7 in the liver parenchyma was strongly correlated 
      with major AEs (P = 0.0002). CONCLUSION: DCE-US may be useful for the early 
      prediction of tumour response and major AEs in patients with HCC.

TI  - Biological evaluation of a novel sorafenib analogue, t-CUPM.
PG  - 161-71
LID - 10.1007/s00280-014-2626-2 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib (Nexavar®) is currently the only FDA-approved small molecule targeted 
      therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The use of structural analogues 
      and derivatives of sorafenib has enabled the elucidation of critical targets and 
      mechanism(s) of cell death for human cancer lines. We previously performed a 
      structure-activity relationship study on a series of sorafenib analogues designed 
      to investigate the inhibition overlap between the major targets of sorafenib 
      Raf-1 kinase and VEGFR-2, and an enzyme shown to be a potent off-target of 
      sorafenib, soluble epoxide hydrolase. In the current work, we present the 
      biological data on our lead sorafenib analogue, t-CUPM, demonstrating that this 
      analogue retains cytotoxicity similar to sorafenib in various human cancer cell 
      lines and strongly inhibits growth in the NCI-60 cell line panel. Co-treatment 
      with the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, failed to rescue the cell viability 
      responses of both sorafenib and t-CUPM, and immunofluorescence microscopy shows 
      similar mitochondrial depolarization and apoptosis-inducing factor release for 
      both compounds. These data suggest that both compounds induce a similar mechanism 
      of caspase-independent apoptosis in hepatoma cells. In addition, t-CUPM displays 
      anti-proliferative effects comparable to sorafenib as seen by a halt in G0/G1 in 
      cell cycle progression. The structural difference between sorafenib and t-CUPM 
      significantly reduces inhibitory spectrum of kinases by this analogue, and 
      pharmacokinetic characterization demonstrates a 20-fold better oral 
      bioavailability of t-CUPM than sorafenib in mice. Thus, t-CUPM may have the 
      potential to reduce the adverse events observed from the multikinase inhibitory 
      properties and the large dosing regimens of sorafenib.

TI  - Double-transduced MDCKII cells to study human P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and breast 
      cancer resistance protein (ABCG2) interplay in drug transport across the 
      blood-brain barrier.
PG  - 571-82
LID - 10.1021/mp1003898 [doi]
AB  - P-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) 
      combination knockout mice display disproportionately increased brain penetration 
      of shared substrates, including topotecan and several tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 
      compared to mice deficient for only one transporter. To better study the 
      interplay of both transporters also in vitro, we generated a transduced polarized 
      MDCKII cell line stably coexpressing substantial levels of human ABCB1 and ABCG2 
      (MDCKII-ABCB1/ABCG2). Next, we measured concentration-dependent transepithelial 
      transport of topotecan, sorafenib and sunitinib. By blocking either one or both 
      of the transporters simultaneously, using specific inhibitors, we aimed to mimic 
      the ABCB1-ABCG2 interplay at the blood-brain barrier in wild-type, single or 
      combination knockout mice. ABCB1 and ABCG2 contributed to similar extents to 
      topotecan transport, which was only partly saturable. For sorafenib transport, 
      ABCG2 was the major determinant at low concentrations. However, saturation of 
      ABCG2-mediated transport occurred at higher sorafenib concentrations, where ABCB1 
      was still fully active. Furthermore, sunitinib was transported equally by ABCB1 
      and ABCG2 at low concentrations, but ABCG2-mediated transport became saturated at 
      lower concentrations than ABCB1-mediated transport. The relative impact of these 
      transporters can thus be affected by the applied drug concentrations. A 
      comparison of the in vitro observed (inverse) transport ratios and cellular 
      accumulation of the drugs at low concentrations with in vivo brain penetration 
      data from corresponding Abcb1a/1b⁻/⁻, Abcg2⁻/⁻ and Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2⁻/⁻ mouse 
      strains revealed very similar qualitative patterns for each of the tested drugs. 
      MDCKII-ABCB1/ABCG2 cells thus present a useful in vitro model to study the 
      interplay of ABCB1 and ABCG2.

TI  - Tivozanib: practical implications for renal cell carcinoma and other solid 
      tumors.
PG  - 303-15
LID - 10.1358/dot.2013.49.5.1960218 [doi]
AB  - Tivozanib is a recently developed, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor with 
      specific affinity for the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 
      family of kinases. Given known relevance of VHL (Von Hippel-Lindau disease tumor 
      suppressor) deregulation in the clear cell variant of renal cell carcinoma, renal 
      cell carcinoma remains an area of interest and subject of recent registration 
      trials with this approach. TIVO-1, a phase III study evaluating tivozanib versus 
      sorafenib in the first-line setting, met its primary endpoint of progression-free 
      survival (11.9 months for tivozanib vs. 9.1 months for sorafenib), with a 
      manageable toxicity profile, leading to formal consideration of regulatory 
      approval in this setting. This review focuses on the preclinical development, 
      pharmacokinetics and early clinical activity of tivozanib in renal cell carcinoma 
      and other solid tumors.

AB  - Sorafenib (SFN), a hydrophobic anticancer drug, has several limitations 
      predominantly poor aqueous solubility and hepatic first-pass effect, limiting its 
      oral delivery that results into several other complications. Present study aims 
      to develop Sorafenib loaded polymersomes using poly butadiene block poly ethylene 
      oxide (PB-b-PEO), an amphiphilic co-block polymer. Prior to drug loading, 
      critical aggregate concentration (CAC) of polymer was calculated for stable 
      formulation synthesis. The developed SFN loaded PB-b-PEO polymersomes 
      (SFN-PB-b-PEO, test formulation) characterized by DLS and cryo-TEM showed 
      particle size 282 nm, polydispersity (PDI) of less than 0.29 and membrane 
      thickness of about 20 nm. SFN-PB-b-PEO polymersomes demonstrated encapsulation 
      efficiency of 71% and showed sustained drug release up to 144 h. Formulation 
      remained stable for 3 months in suspension form. In vitro cytotoxicity against 
      HepG2 cells showed 1.7 folds improved toxicity compared to SFN suspension. In 
      addition, oral administration of SFN-PB-b-PEO polymersomes in BALB/c mice showed 
      increased C(max) and AUC(0-96) by 1.7 and 2.77-fold respectively (p < 0.05) 
      compared to those of SFN suspension (reference formulation). Findings suggest 
      that the SFN-PB-b-PEO polymersomes can be a potential candidate for oral delivery 
      of SFN.

AB  - Angiogenesis has become an innovative target in cancer therapy. Agents that 
      inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), one of the most potent 
      promoters of angiogenesis, and its receptor have significant implications for 
      clinical practice. Bevacizumab, sorafenib, sunitinib and other anti-VEGF drugs 
      are frequently complicated by mild proteinuria and hypertension. Other unique 
      renal effects, such as high-grade proteinuria and acute kidney injury, have been 
      described. The most common histopathologic kidney lesion is thrombotic 
      microangiopathy, with other glomerular lesions and interstitial nephritis 
      occurring less frequently. The mechanism for anti-VEGF therapy-induced 
      hypertension is not well understood; however, nitric oxide pathway inhibition, 
      rarefaction, and oxidative stress may be important in its pathogenesis. 
      Glomerular injury may develop from loss of VEGF effect on maintaining the 
      filtration barrier. Adverse effects of anti-VEGF class of drugs are manageable 
      but require close attention and follow-up. Understanding the fundamentals of 
      anti-VEGF drugs' mechanism of action and their clinical implications is crucial 
      when caring for patients receiving anti-VEGF therapy.

TI  - Tolerability of oral sorafenib in pet dogs with a diagnosis of cancer.
PG  - 97-102
LID - 10.2147/VMRR.S149678 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib is a multi-target small molecule inhibitor of the RAF kinase family and 
      VEGFR-2/PDGFR. The US Food and Drug Administration approved sorafenib in human 
      patients with liver, thyroid, or renal carcinoma. The aim of this study was to 
      help guide future pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of sorafenib in dogs with a cancer 
      diagnosis. Client-owned dogs were eligible if they had a cytologic or histologic 
      diagnosis of cancer. Patients were enrolled at escalating doses of sorafenib. 
      Patients were evaluable for the study if they received at least one dose of 
      sorafenib and presented 1 week later for a follow-up examination, blood work, and 
      assessment of drug tolerability. The goal of this study was not to define a 
      maximum tolerated dose as may be reasonable in conventional cytotoxic 
      chemotherapy drugs, but rather to describe the tolerability of this drug in dogs 
      with a cancer diagnosis, as a prequel to future sorafenib PK studies. No patients 
      in the study had any evidence of adverse events that were attributable to 
      sorafenib. Doses of 3 mg/kg were well tolerated and associated with a suggestion 
      of clinical activity, supportive of future PK, and pharmacodynamic analysis. Such 
      future studies are recommended at this dose to define the associated exposure 
      achieved and determine a reasonable schedule for sorafenib administration.

      Pharmacotherapy].
PG  - 1469-1476
AB  - After the year 2000, the treatment of cancer remarkably changed, including the 
      development of outpatient cancer chemotherapy. Meanwhile, we have encountered 
      many clinical problems related to cancer patient pharmacy services. To resolve 
      these problems, I have tried to establish the individualized and optimal cancer 
      pharmacotherapy utilizing the findings of basic research. In this review, three 
      topics of my research will be introduced. 1) In 2005, information regarding the 
      genetic polymorphism of UGT1A1*28 was described in the package insert of the drug 
      irinotecan in the United States. At that time, however, there was little similar 
      information for Japanese patients. Through clinical research, we demonstrated 
      that UGT1A1*6 was a significant factor for neutropenia, as induced by irinotecan. 
      2) Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are mainly used at a fixed dose, but wide 
      interpatient variability has been observed relative to their pharmacokinetics 
      and/or pharmacodynamics. To overcome these variations, clinical and basic 
      pharmacological research on erlotinib, sorafenib and sunitinib was carried out. 
      Especially, in sunitinib therapy, we demonstrated that the breast cancer 
      resistant protein in the intestine functions as a limiting factor for oral 
      absorption, and that therapeutic drug monitoring could be helpful for avoiding 
      severe toxicities, resulting in prolonged progression-free survival. 3) We 
      quantitatively assessed side effect management by pharmacist intervention for 
      outpatient chemotherapy. We calculated the improvement ratio between before and 
      after pharmacist intervention, and found that 135 suggestions (50.8%) led to 
      significant improvements, indicating that pharmacist intervention could be useful 
      for attenuating the side effects of cancer chemotherapies.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic interaction involving sorafenib and the calcium-channel blocker 
      felodipine in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 1511-4
LID - 10.1007/s10637-010-9514-3 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib, an orally active multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is primarily metabolized both via cytochrome P450 
      3A4 isoform (CYP3A4) and UGT1A9. Due to the contribution of these two 
      biotransformation pathways, sorafenib is considered to be less susceptible than 
      other agents to CYP3A4 drug-drug interactions. This report discusses a clinically 
      relevant pharmacokinetic CYP3A4 drug-drug interaction between sorafenib and 
      felodipine in an 80-year-old Caucasian patient with HCC. On day 15, after the 
      introduction of sorafenib (400 mg bid), sorafenib plasma concentration was at 
      3.6 mg/L. Felodipine (5 mg bid), an anti-hypertensive agent that is exclusively 
      CYP3A4 substrate, was then introduced due to grade 2 sorafenib-related 
      hypertension. On day 30, hypertension was well controlled. However, sorafenib 
      plasma concentration was 3-fold greater (11.4 mg/L) and the patient experienced 
      grade-3 anorexia. Since neither diarrhea nor cutaneous side effects were noticed 
      at this time, sorafenib treatment was continued at the same daily dosage. On day 
      45, sorafenib plasma concentration was stable (10.8 mg/L) before declining on 
      days 60 and 75 (7.0 mg/L and 7.4 mg/L, respectively), which was probably related 
      to an occurrence of grade-2 diarrhea. This observation suggests a pharmacokinetic 
      interaction involving CYP3A4 inhibition by felodipine. According to the Drug 
      Interaction Probability Scale, this interaction was possible. Since hypertension 
      is a common toxicity of sorafenib, clinicians should be aware of this possible 
      interaction. The clinical relevance of pharmacokinetic interactions involving 
      CYP3A4 inhibition in HCC patients receiving sorafenib is analyzed in this case 
      report.

TI  - Therapeutic Drug Monitoring of the new targeted anticancer agents imatinib, 
      nilotinib, dasatinib, sunitinib, sorafenib and lapatinib by LC tandem mass 
      spectrometry.
PG  - 1982-96
LID - 10.1016/j.jchromb.2009.04.045 [doi]
AB  - The treatment of some cancer patients has shifted from traditional, non-specific 
      cytotoxic chemotherapy to chronic treatment with molecular targeted therapies. 
      Imatinib mesylate, a selective inhibitor of tyrosine kinases (TKIs) is the most 
      prominent example of this new era and has opened the way to the development of 
      several additional TKIs, including sunitinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, sorafenib and 
      lapatinib, in the treatment of various hematological malignancies and solid 
      tumors. All these agents are characterized by an important inter-individual 
      pharmacokinetic variability, are at risk for drug interactions, and are not 
      devoid of toxicity. Additionally, they are administered for prolonged periods, 
      anticipating the careful monitoring of their plasma exposure via Therapeutic Drug 
      Monitoring (TDM) to be an important component of patients' follow-up. We have 
      developed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS) 
      requiring 100 microL of plasma for the simultaneous determination of the six 
      major TKIs currently in use. Plasma is purified by protein precipitation and the 
      supernatant is diluted in ammonium formate 20 mM (pH 4.0) 1:2. Reverse-phase 
      chromatographic separation of TKIs is obtained using a gradient elution of 20 mM 
      ammonium formate pH 2.2 and acetonitrile containing 1% formic acid, followed by 
      rinsing and re-equilibration to the initial solvent composition up to 20 min. 
      Analyte quantification, using matrix-matched calibration samples, is performed by 
      electro-spray ionization-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry by selected reaction 
      monitoring detection using the positive mode. The method was validated according 
      to FDA recommendations, including assessment of extraction yield, matrix effects 
      variability (<9.6%), overall process efficiency (87.1-104.2%), as well as TKIs 
      short- and long-term stability in plasma. The method is precise (inter-day CV%: 
      1.3-9.4%), accurate (-9.2 to +9.9%) and sensitive (lower limits of quantification 
      comprised between 1 and 10 ng/mL). This is the first broad-range LC-MS/MS assay 
      covering the major currently in-use TKIs. It is an improvement over previous 
      methods in terms of convenience (a single extraction procedure for six major 
      TKIs, reducing significantly the analytical time), sensitivity, selectivity and 
      throughput. It may contribute to filling the current knowledge gaps in the 
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics relationships of the latest TKIs developed 
      after imatinib and better define their therapeutic ranges in different patient 
      populations in order to evaluate whether a systematic TDM-guided dose adjustment 
      of these anticancer drugs could contribute to minimize the risk of major adverse 
      reactions and to increase the probability of efficient, long lasting, therapeutic 
      response.

AB  - VEGFR inhibitors are in broad use for the treatment of metastatic renal-cell 
      carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors and hepatocellular carcinoma and in 
      development in a number of other oncology indications, including colorectal 
      cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, thyroid malignancies, 
      ovarian cancer, breast cancer and sarcomas. This Review outlines the 
      structure-activity relationships of the 44 VEGFR inhibitors currently in 
      development. An overview of the pharmacokinetic profile of each molecule and its 
      stage in development is provided. Phase III clinical trials being conducted for 
      licensing of these agents for specific indications and phase III developmental 
      efficacy trials are described in detailed tables that include the disease 
      studied, trial design including combination therapy, study end points, and 
      projected or final accrual. The relative frequency of on-target and off-target 
      adverse events observed in 3,060 patients is described for a subset of agents in 
      development in clinical trials sponsored by the National Cancer Institute. No 
      interagent comparisons were undertaken and no data from pharmaceutical 
      pharmacovigilance databases were used. The on-target effects seem to be 
      mechanistically based and predicted by VEGFR inhibition. Small-molecule 
      inhibitors of angiogenesis are active in a wide variety of malignancies and fill 
      a unique niche for cancer therapeutics.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Reducing cancer-treatment toxicity was a largely ignored 
      research agenda, which is now emerging as an active area of investigation. 
      Studies of human body composition using computerized tomography scans have 
      provided proof-of-concept that variability in drug disposition and toxicity 
      profiles may be partially explained by different features in body composition. 
      RECENT FINDINGS: Collectively, studies suggest that skeletal muscle depletion 
      (regardless of body weight) is an independent predictor of severe toxicity, 
      affecting cancer treatment and its outcomes. Although precise mechanisms are 
      unknown, pharmacokinetic parameters such as variations in volume of distribution 
      and increased drug exposure may explain such findings. SUMMARY: Computerized 
      tomography scans are readily available in clinical databases of diagnostic images 
      and provide feasible, reliable, and highly differentiated measurements of body 
      composition. These images should be used to optimize screening and management of 
      patients in order to prevent severe toxicity, and to improve the efficacy and 
      cost-efficiency of chemotherapy treatments.

PG  - 705-10
LID - 10.1097/FTD.0b013e3182357891 [doi]
AB  - A simple liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method was developed and 
      validated for quantification of sorafenib (Nexavar) in human plasma. After a 
      solid-phase extraction procedure, the separation was performed within 2 minutes 
      using an isocratic flow of a mobile phase consisting of formic acid/acetonitrile 
      applied on a C18 analytical column. The analyte was detected by mass spectrometry 
      in the single-ion monitoring mode. The method was validated according to the 
      recommendations of the US Food and Drug Administration. The method was linear (r² 
      > 0.99) between 10 and 10,000 ng/mL. The lower limits of detection and 
      quantification were 5 and 10 ng/mL, respectively. Within-day and between-day 
      imprecisions were less than 10.4%, and inaccuracy did not exceed 8.7%. The mean 
      extraction recovery was 92.2%. The method also provided satisfactory results in 
      terms of time stability and dilution integrity. Sorafenib plasma concentrations 
      of the studied patient ranged between 1831 and 3459 ng/mL. This new technique is 
      rapid, sensitive, and was applied to the determination of sorafenib plasma 
      concentrations in a patient undergoing hemodialysis. Our results indicate that 
      sorafenib is not cleared from plasma by hemodialysis, although analysis should be 
      delayed after dialysis to avoid erratic fluctuations.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sorafenib is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment 
      of renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, thyroid carcinoma, and desmoid 
      fibromatosis. As high inter-individual variability exists in exposure, there is a 
      scientific rationale to pursue therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). We investigated 
      the feasibility of TDM in patients on sorafenib and tried to identify sub-groups 
      in whom pharmacokinetically (PK) guided-dosing might be of added value. METHODS: 
      We included patients who started on sorafenib (between October 2017 and June 
      2020) at the recommended dose of 400 mg BID or with a step-up dosing schedule. 
      Plasma trough levels (C(trough)) were measured at pre-specified time-points. 
      Increasing the dose was advised if C(trough) was below the target of 3750 ng/mL 
      and toxicity was manageable. RESULTS: A total of 150 samples from 36 patients 
      were collected. Thirty patients (83 %) had a C(trough) below the prespecified 
      target concentration at a certain time point during treatment. Toxicity from 
      sorafenib hampered dosing according to target C(trough) in almost half of the 
      patients. In 11 patients, dosing was adjusted based on C(trough). In three 
      patients, this resulted in an adequate C(trough) without additional toxicity four 
      weeks after the dose increase. In the remaining eight patients, dose adjustment 
      based on C(trough) did not result in a C(trough) above the target or caused 
      excessive toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: TDM for sorafenib is not of added value in daily 
      clinical practice. In most cases, toxicity restricts the possibility of dose 
      escalations.

AB  - Angiogenesis is essential in the growth of solid tumors which need oxygen and 
      nutrients supply to grow in size. The VEGF/VEGFR-2 signaling pathway plays an 
      important role in tumor angiogenesis. Sorafenib is an FDA approved cancer 
      therapeutic with activity against many protein kinases, including VEGFR. We 
      designed 4-piperazinylquinolin-2(1H)-ones with variable aromatic moieties and 
      Mannich bases as Sorafenib analogues as potential inhibitors of angiogenesis. In 
      this study, we investigated the impact of replacing the linker aromatic ring with 
      cyclic tertiary amines and the effect of incorporation of variably substituted 
      distal rings. We hypothesized that cyclic tertiary amines would improve 
      pharmacokinetic properties and contribute to enzyme interactions. Two series of 
      piperazinylquinolinone-based compounds were synthesized, characterized, and 
      evaluated for bioactivity against adenocarcinoma EKVX NSCLC and T-47D breast 
      cancer cells. Ability to inhibit VEGFR-2 and apoptosis were investigated and 
      molecular docking into the enzyme active site and theoretical ADME properties 
      were determined. Notably, amongst series I three compounds exhibited higher 
      anticancer activity than Staurosporine against EKVX NSCLC adenocarcinoma cell 
      line. In series II, nine compounds exhibited higher antiproliferative activity 
      than Staurosporine against T-47D breast cancer cell line. Two compounds; 5d and 
      7z exhibited lower toxicity against normal cell line (MCF 10A) than 
      Staurosporine. Compound 7z was the most potent agent with IC(50) 38.76 nM. 
      Moreover, 7z showed VEGFR-2 inhibitory activity higher than sorafenib and induced 
      remarkable levels of both early and late apoptosis (2.82% and 21.30%, 
      respectively). Hence, 5d and 7z are considered promising VEGFR-2 inhibitors with 
      high efficacy against adenocarcinoma EKVX and T-47D breast cancer cells. The 
      target compounds also possessed favorable physicochemical properties and 
      pharmacokinetic parameters These studies further suggested that the 
      4-piperazinylquinolin-2(1H)-one derivatives developed in this study play a 
      critical role in modulating VEGFR, and guide the design of innovative anticancer 
      therapies.

AB  - Human protein tyrosine kinases play an essential role in carcinogenesis and have 
      been recognized as promising drug targets. By the end of 2012, eight small 
      molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been approved by State Food and 
      Drug Administration of China for cancer treatment. In this paper, the 
      pharmacokinetic characteristics (absorption, distribution, metabolism and 
      excretion) and drug-drug interactions of the approved TKIs are reviewed. Overall, 
      these TKIs reach their peak plasma concentrations relatively fast; are 
      extensively distributed and highly protein bound (> 90%); are primarily 
      metabolized by CYP3A4; most are heavily influenced by CYP3A4 inhibitors or 
      inducers except for sorafenib; are mainly excreted with feces and only a minor 
      fraction is eliminated with the urine; and are substrate of the efflux 
      transporters ABCB1 (P-gp) and ABCG2 (BCRP). Additionally, many of the TKIs can 
      inhibit some CYP450 enzymes, UGT enzymes, and transporters. Gefitinib, erlotinib, 
      dasatinib, and sunitinib are metabolized to form reactive metabolites capable of 
      covalently binding to biomolecules.

TI  - Rationale and design of decision: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled 
      phase III trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of sorafenib in patients with 
      locally advanced or metastatic radioactive iodine (RAI)-refractory, 
      differentiated thyroid cancer.
PG  - 349
LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-11-349 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence of thyroid cancer and the number of patients who die 
      from this disease are increasing globally. Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) is 
      the histologic subtype present in most patients and is primarily responsible for 
      the increased overall incidence of thyroid cancer. Sorafenib is a multikinase 
      inhibitor that targets several molecular signals believed to be involved in the 
      pathogenesis of thyroid cancer, including those implicated in DTC. In phase II 
      studies of patients with DTC, sorafenib treatment has yielded a median 
      progression-free survival (PFS) of 58 to 84 weeks and disease control rates of 
      59% to 100%. The DECISION trial was designed to assess the ability of sorafenib 
      to improve PFS in patients with locally advanced or metastatic, radioactive 
      iodine (RAI)-refractory DTC. METHODS/DESIGN: DECISION is a multicenter, 
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III study in patients with 
      locally advanced/metastatic RAI-refractory DTC. Study treatment will continue 
      until radiographically documented disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, 
      noncompliance, or withdrawal of consent. Efficacy will be evaluated every 56 days 
      (2 cycles), whereas safety will be evaluated every 28 days (1 cycle) for the 
      first 8 months and every 56 days thereafter. Following disease progression, 
      patients may continue or start sorafenib, depending on whether they were 
      randomized to receive sorafenib or placebo, at investigator discretion. Patients 
      originally randomized to receive sorafenib will be followed up every 3 months for 
      overall survival (OS); patients originally randomized to receive placebo will be 
      followed up every month for 8 months after cross-over to sorafenib. The duration 
      of the trial is expected to be 30 months from the time the first patient is 
      randomized until the planned number of PFS events is attained. The primary 
      endpoint is PFS; secondary endpoints include OS, time to disease progression, 
      disease control rate, response rate, duration of response, safety, and 
      pharmacokinetic analysis. DISCUSSION: The DECISION study has been designed to 
      test whether sorafenib improves PFS in patients with locally advanced or 
      metastatic RAI-refractory DTC. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: 
      NCT00984282; EudraCT: 2009-012007-25.

TI  - Repurposing human kinase inhibitors to create an antibiotic active against 
      drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, persisters and biofilms.
PG  - 145-158
LID - 10.1038/s41557-019-0378-7 [doi]
AB  - New drugs are desperately needed to combat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
      aureus (MRSA) infections. Here, we report screening commercial kinase inhibitors 
      for antibacterial activity and found the anticancer drug sorafenib as major hit 
      that effectively kills MRSA strains. Varying the key structural features led to 
      the identification of a potent analogue, PK150, that showed antibacterial 
      activity against several pathogenic strains at submicromolar concentrations. 
      Furthermore, this antibiotic eliminated challenging persisters as well as 
      established biofilms. PK150 holds promising therapeutic potential as it did not 
      induce in vitro resistance, and shows oral bioavailability and in vivo efficacy. 
      Analysis of the mode of action using chemical proteomics revealed several 
      targets, which included interference with menaquinone biosynthesis by inhibiting 
      demethylmenaquinone methyltransferase and the stimulation of protein secretion by 
      altering the activity of signal peptidase IB. Reduced endogenous menaquinone 
      levels along with enhanced levels of extracellular proteins of PK150-treated 
      bacteria support this target hypothesis. The associated antibiotic effects, 
      especially the lack of resistance development, probably stem from the compound's 
      polypharmacology.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignancy of the liver 
      accounting for approximately 90% of cases. Patients often present at an advanced 
      stage when treatment options are limited. Sorafenib, a multitargeted tyrosine 
      kinase inhibitor, has been the first-line treatment in this setting for almost a 
      decade. Several subsequent targeted therapies have failed to demonstrate 
      significant improvement in survival. The results of the REFLECT study suggest 
      that lenvatinib, a multikinase inhibitor, may have promised as a first-line 
      treatment in patients with advanced HCC. This article will review the development 
      of lenvatinib and the evidence behind its potential use in patients with advanced 
      HCC.

AB  - In the recent years, eight tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been approved 
      for cancer treatment and numerous are under investigation. These drugs are 
      rationally designed to target specific tyrosine kinases that are mutated and/or 
      over-expressed in cancer tissues. Post marketing study commitments have been made 
      upon (accelerated) approval such as additional pharmacokinetic studies in 
      patients with renal- or hepatic impairment, in children, additional interactions 
      studies and studies on the relative or absolute bioavailability. Therefore, much 
      information will emerge on the pharmacokinetic behavior of these drugs after 
      their approval. In the present manuscript, the pharmacokinetic characteristics; 
      absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME), of the available TKIs 
      are reviewed. Results from additional studies on the effect of drug transporters 
      and drug-drug interactions have been incorporated. Overall, the TKIs reach their 
      maximum plasma levels relatively fast; have an unknown absolute bioavailability, 
      are extensively distributed and highly protein bound. The drugs are primarily 
      metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 with other CYP-enzymes playing a 
      secondary role. They are predominantly excreted with the feces and only a minor 
      fraction is eliminated with the urine. All TKIs appear to be transported by the 
      efflux ATP binding-cassette transports B1 and G2. Additionally these drugs can 
      inhibit some of their own metabolizing enzymes and transporters making 
      steady-state metabolism and drug-drug interactions both complex and 
      unpredictable. By understanding the pharmacokinetic profile of these drugs and 
      their similarities, factors that influence drug exposure will be better 
      recognized and this knowledge may be used to limit sub- or supra-therapeutic drug 
      exposure.

PG  - 1377-95

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Activating mutations of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene 
      occur at high frequency in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), being detected in > 30% 
      of patients at diagnosis and carrying a profound negative prognostic impact. The 
      development of effective small molecule inhibitors of FLT3 has been the focus of 
      an intensive international research effort in recent years. AREAS COVERED: The 
      published results of the first decade of clinical trials of FLT3-targeted 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors are critically reviewed. Over this period, a first 
      generation of compounds has followed an orderly progression from monotherapy 
      studies through combination with chemotherapy and into advanced stage 
      international trials in both relapsed and newly-diagnosed AML. Correlative 
      laboratory studies performed alongside several of these studies have been highly 
      illuminating, demonstrating close correlations between clinical activity and 
      effective inhibition of FLT3, and highlighting potential drug resistance 
      mechanisms. EXPERT OPINION: Clinical responses to several of the early 
      multi-targeted agents were hindered by unfavorable pharmacokinetics and lack of 
      potency. Newer, more potent FLT3 inhibitors such as sorafenib and AC220 possess 
      the ability to achieve more sustained in vivo inhibition of FLT3 and have shown 
      highly promising activity in early clinical studies. As these agents enter 
      advanced stage trials, they carry the potential to make a major clinical impact 
      in this disease. In future, FLT3 inhibitors may be effectively used in 
      combination with other molecularly targeted agents.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The individual response to targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) 
      in the treatment of metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC) is highly variable. 
      Outlined in this article are findings on potential biomarkers for TKI treatment 
      outcome in mRCC and an evaluation of the status of clinical implementation. 
      METHODS: Articles were selected by two independent reviewers using a systematic 
      search in five medical databases on renal cell carcinoma, TKIs, and 
      pharmacogenetics. RESULTS: Many researchers have focused on predictive biomarkers 
      for treatment outcome of targeted therapies in mRCC patients. Attempts to explain 
      differences in efficacy and toxicity of TKIs by use of genetic variants in genes 
      related to the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug have been 
      successful. CONCLUSION: Most findings on potential biomarkers have not been 
      validated and therefore biomarker testing to guide choice of therapy and dose in 
      mRCC is not yet feasible.

AB  - Introduction: Acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) is the most frequent type of 
      acute leukemia in adults with an incidence of 4.2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants 
      and poor 5-year survival. Patients with mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 
      3 (FLT3) gene have poor survival and higher relapse rates compared with wild-type 
      cases.Areas covered: Several FLT3 inhibitors have been proved in FLT3(mut) AML 
      patients, with differences in their pharmacokinetics, kinase inhibitory and 
      adverse events profiles. First-generation multi-kinase inhibitors (midostaurin, 
      sorafenib, lestaurtinib) target multiple proteins, whereassecond-generation 
      inhibitors (crenolanib, quizartinib, gilteritinib) are more specific and potent 
      inhibitors of FLT3, so they are associated with less off-target toxic effects. 
      All of these drugs have primary and acquired mechanisms of resistance, and 
      therefore their combinations with other drugs (checkpoint inhibitors, 
      hypomethylating agents, standard chemotherapy) and its application in different 
      clinical settings are under study.Expert opinion: The recent clinical development 
      of various FLT3 inhibitors for the treatment of FLT3(mut) AML is an effective 
      therapeutic strategy. However, there are unique toxicities and drug-drug 
      interactions that need to be resolved. It is necessary to understand the 
      mechanisms of toxicity in order to recognize and manage them adequately.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and 
      antitumor activity. In most cases, the commercially available 200 mg tablet is 
      not suitable for administration to children. We studied the chemical and physical 
      stability of extemporaneously prepared formulations and evaluated the 
      pharmacokinetic profile of cut tablets and smaller-dosage capsules of sorafenib 
      in children. PROCEDURE: Commercially available 200 mg tablets of sorafenib 
      tosylate were used to prepare liquid suspensions of sorafenib in oil and 
      Ora-Plus(®):Ora-Sweet(®) solution, and to prepare 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 mg 
      capsules. Plasma concentrations of sorafenib were measured in patients receiving 
      capsules and cut tablets, using a validated HPLC-based method with tandem mass 
      spectrometric detection. RESULTS: At room temperature and under refrigeration, 
      sorafenib concentrations in Ora Plus(®):Ora Sweet(®) were highly variable (means 
      ranging from 75% to 131% of the intended concentration of 50 mg/ml). In oil 
      suspension, sorafenib concentrations were inconsistent during compounding. In 
      contrast, all smaller-dosage capsules, except the 5 mg capsule, were within 
      91-99% of the intended content and were stable at room temperature for at least 8 
      months. Sorafenib pharmacokinetic parameters in patients receiving capsules or 
      cut tablets were consistent with those reported previously in adults and children 
      receiving intact tablets. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib is not stable in an oral 
      suspension prepared from commercially available tablets, but compounded capsules 
      in smaller-dosage forms that can be sprinkled on food or cut tablets are 
      alternatives for administration to children who need smaller doses based on body 
      surface area or cannot swallow tablets.

TI  - A Phase Ib Study of Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) in Patients with Kaposi Sarcoma.
PG  - 505-e49
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2016-0486 [doi]
AB  - LESSONS LEARNED: Oral targeted agents are desirable for treatment of Kaposi 
      sarcoma (KS); however, in patients with HIV, drug-drug interactions must be 
      considered. In this study to treat KS, sorafenib was poorly tolerated at doses 
      less than those approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma and other cancers, and showed only modest 
      activity.Sorafenib's metabolism occurs via the CYP3A4 pathway, which is inhibited 
      by ritonavir, a commonly used antiretroviral agent used by most patients in this 
      study. Strong CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir may contribute to the observed 
      sorafenib toxicity.Alternate antiretroviral agents without predicted interactions 
      are preferred for co-administration in patients with HIV and cancers for which 
      sorafenib is indicated. BACKGROUND: We conducted a phase Ib study of sorafenib, a 
      vascular epithelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), c-kit, and platelet derived 
      growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-targeted treatment in Kaposi sarcoma (KS). We 
      evaluated drug-drug interactions between sorafenib and ritonavir, an HIV 
      medication with strong CYP3A4 inhibitory activity. METHODS: Two cohorts were 
      enrolled: HIV-related KS on ritonavir (Cohort R) and HIV-related or classical KS 
      not receiving ritonavir (Cohort NR). Sorafenib dose level 1 in cohort R (R1) was 
      200 mg daily and 200 mg every 12 hours in cohort NR (NR1). Steady-state 
      pharmacokinetics were evaluated at cycle 1, day 8. KS responses and correlative 
      factors were assessed. RESULTS: Ten patients (nine HIV(+)) were enrolled: R1 
      (eight), NR1 (two). Median CD4(+) count (HIV(+)) was 500 cells/µL. Dose-limiting 
      toxicities (DLTs) were grade 3 elevated lipase (R1), grade 4 thrombocytopenia 
      (R1), and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome (NR1). Two of seven evaluable patients had a 
      partial response (PR; 29%; 95% CI 4%-71%). Steady-state area under the curve of 
      the dosing interval (AUC(TAU)) of sorafenib was not significantly affected by 
      ritonavir; however, a trend for decreased AUC(TAU) of the CYP3A4 metabolite 
      sorafenib-N-oxide (3.8-fold decrease; p = .08) suggests other metabolites may be 
      increased. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib was poorly tolerated, and anti-KS activity was 
      modest. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may contribute to sorafenib toxicity, and 
      ritonavir has previously been shown to be a CYP3A4 inhibitor. Alternate 
      antiretroviral agents without predicted interactions should be used when possible 
      for concurrent administration with sorafenib. The Oncologist 2017;22:505-e49.

TI  - A physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling approach for 
      drug-drug interaction evaluation of warfarin enantiomers with sorafenib.

AB  - Sorafenib was suggested to cause drug-drug interaction (DDI) with the common 
      anticoagulant, warfarin based on published studies. The inhibition on CYP2C9 
      enzyme was thought to be the mechanism, but further studies are warranted. Thus, 
      a mechanistic PBPK/PD model for warfarin enantiomers was developed to predict DDI 
      potential with sorafenib, aiming at providing reference for the rational use of 
      both drugs. PBPK models of warfarin enantiomers were constructed by Simcyp 
      software. A mechanistic PK/PD model was built in NONMEM software. PBPK model of 
      sorafenib was fitted via a top-down method. The final PBPK/PD model of warfarin 
      enantiomers was verified and validated by different dosing regimens, ethnicities 
      and genetic polymorphisms, and used to perform DDI simulations between warfarin 
      racemate and sorafenib among general populations and sub-populations with various 
      CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genotypes. Results suggested low DDI risk between warfarin and 
      sorafenib for general populations. Potentially serious consequence was seen for 
      those carrying both CYP2C9 ∗2 and ∗3 and VKORC1 A/A genotypes. This PBPK/PD 
      modeling approach for warfarin enantiomers enabled DDI evaluation with sorafenib. 
      Close monitoring and warfarin dosage adjustment were recommended for patients 
      carrying mutant genotypes. The novel model could be applied to investigate other 
      drugs that may interact with warfarin.

TI  - A phase II study of the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of the MEK 
      inhibitor refametinib (BAY 86-9766) plus sorafenib for Asian patients with 
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 5976-85
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-3445 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: There is an unmet need for treatment options in hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC). Sorafenib is currently the only approved systemic treatment for HCC. 
      Refametinib, an oral, allosteric MEK inhibitor, has demonstrated antitumor 
      activity in combination with sorafenib in vitro and in vivo. A phase II study 
      evaluated efficacy and safety of refametinib plus sorafenib in Asian patients 
      with HCC (NCT01204177). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eligible patients received 
      twice-daily refametinib 50 mg plus twice-daily sorafenib 200 mg (morning)/400 mg 
      (evening), with dose escalation to sorafenib 400 mg twice daily from cycle 2 if 
      no grade ≥ 2 hand-foot skin reaction, fatigue, or gastrointestinal toxicity 
      occurred. Primary efficacy endpoint: disease control rate. Secondary endpoints: 
      time to progression, overall survival, pharmacokinetic assessment, biomarker 
      analysis, safety, and tolerability. RESULTS: Of 95 enrolled patients, 70 received 
      study treatment. Most patients had liver cirrhosis (82.9%) and hepatitis B viral 
      infection (75.7%). Disease control rate was 44.8% (primary efficacy analysis; n = 
      58). Median time to progression was 122 days, median overall survival was 290 
      days (n = 70). Best clinical responders had RAS mutations; majority of poor 
      responders had wild-type RAS. Most frequent drug-related adverse events were 
      diarrhea, rash, aspartate aminotransferase elevation, vomiting, and nausea. Dose 
      modifications due to adverse events were necessary in almost all patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Refametinib plus sorafenib showed antitumor activity in patients 
      with HCC and was tolerated at reduced doses by most patients. Frequent dose 
      modifications due to grade 3 adverse events may have contributed to limited 
      treatment effect. Patients with RAS mutations appear to benefit from 
      refametinib/sorafenib combination.

AB  - The combination of doxorubicin (DOX) with sorafenib (SOR) has proven an effective 
      strategy to enhance anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) efficacy. However, 
      respective in vivo pharmacokinetic profiles and different endocytosis capacities 
      of these two drugs greatly hinder their current application. Herein, the 
      tumor-targeting peptide iRGD decorated lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (NPs) 
      with a shell-core structure were developed for co-delivery of DOX and SOR 
      (DOX+SOR/iRGD NPs). After the drug ratio was optimized, the stabilized 
      DOX+SOR/iRGD NPs were prepared. Through the iRGD-integrin recognition, 
      DOX+SOR/iRGD NPs showed synergistic cytotoxicity, pro-apoptotic ability and 
      enhanced internalization rate in human liver cancer HepG2 cells. In vivo 
      pharmacokinetic result demonstrated that an extended circulation and 
      bioavailability of DOX+SOR/iRGD NPs than free drugs. More importantly, 
      DOX+SOR/iRGD NPs significantly enhanced antitumor efficiency in HCC xenograft 
      mouse models. Overall, this study describes a promising nanoparticulate drug 
      co-delivery strategy to combine clinical anticancer drugs and enhance anti-HCC 
      efficacy.

TI  - Resminostat plus sorafenib as second-line therapy of advanced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma - The SHELTER study.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: No established therapies for patients with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) and progression on first-line sorafenib treatment currently 
      exist. This phase I/II trial investigated safety, pharmacokinetics and potential 
      biomarkers of the histone deacetylase inhibitor resminostat and a combination 
      therapy with resminostat and sorafenib. METHODS: Patients with HCC and 
      radiologically confirmed progression on sorafenib were treated in an exploratory, 
      multi-center, open-label, uncontrolled, non-randomized, parallel group phase I/II 
      study. In the combination group (n=38) four dose levels ranged from daily 200 to 
      600mg resminostat plus 400 to 800mg sorafenib. The monotherapy group (n=19) 
      received 600mg resminostat. RESULTS: 57 patients received treatment. Most common 
      adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders, thrombocytopenia and fatigue. 
      Median maximal histone deacetylase inhibition and highest increase in 
      H4-acetylation matched Tmax of resminostat. Sorafenib or the Child-Pugh score did 
      not affect typical pharmacokinetics characteristics of resminostat. Efficacy 
      assessment as progression-free survival-rate after 6 treatment cycles (12weeks, 
      primary endpoint) was 12.5% for resminostat and 62.5% for resminostat plus 
      sorafenib. Median time to progression and overall survival were 1.8 and 4.1months 
      for resminostat and 6.5 and 8.0months for the combination, respectively. Zinc 
      finger protein 64 (ZFP64) baseline expression in blood cells was found to 
      correlate with overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of sorafenib and 
      resminostat in HCC patients was safe and showed early signs of efficacy. 
      Sorafenib did not alter the pharmacokinetic profile of resminostat or its histone 
      deacetylase inhibitory activity in vivo. A prognostic and potentially predictive 
      role of ZFP64 for treatment with resminostat should be further investigated in 
      HCC and possibly other cancer indications. LAY SUMMARY: No established therapy 
      for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and progression under 
      first-line systemic treatment with sorafenib currently exists. Epigenetic 
      modulation by inhibition of histone deacetylases might be able to overcome 
      therapy resistance. This exploratory phase I/II clinical study in patients with 
      radiologically confirmed progression under first-line treatment with sorafenib 
      investigated the histone deacetylases inhibitor resminostat as single agent or in 
      combination with continued application of sorafenib. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      The clinical trial has been registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00943449.

AB  - A selective and precise high-performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet method 
      was developed and validated for the determination of lapatinib in human plasma. 
      After protein precipitation with acetonitrile, lapatinib and sorafenib were 
      separated using isocratic elution (on a C18 Ultrabase column using a mobile phase 
      of acetonitrile/20 mM ammonium acetate in a proportion 53:47 (v/v) pumped at a 
      constant flow rate of 1.2 mL/min). Quantification was performed at 260 nm. 
      Calibration curves were linear over the range 0.2-10 µg/mL. Inter- and intraday 
      coefficients of variation were less than 7%. The limit of detection and the lower 
      limit of quantification were 0.1 and 0.2 µg/mL, respectively. Recoveries of 
      lapatinib from plasma were higher than 86.7% in all cases. The assay was applied 
      to the determination of the drug in the plasma of 2 cancer patients receiving 
      lapatinib, 1000 and 1250 mg orally, and could be useful for therapeutic drug 
      monitoring of lapatinib in routine clinical practice.

AB  - Resistance to conventional and target specific antitumor drugs still remains one 
      of the major cause of treatment failure and patience death. This condition often 
      involves ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that, by pumping the drugs 
      outside from cancer cells, attenuate the potency of chemotherapeutics and 
      negatively impact on the fate of anticancer therapy. In recent years, several 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (e.g., imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, 
      ponatinib, gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, vandetanib, sunitinib, sorafenib) 
      have been reported to interact with ABC transporters (e.g., ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCG2, 
      ABCC10). This finding disclosed a very complex scenario in which TKIs may behave 
      as substrates or inhibitors depending on the expression of specific pumps, drug 
      concentration, affinity for transporters and types of co-administered agents. In 
      this context, in-depth investigation on TKI chemosensitizing functions might 
      provide a strong rationale for combining TKIs and conventional therapeutics in 
      specific malignancies. The reposition of TKIs as antagonists of ABC transporters 
      opens a new way towards anticancer therapy and clinical strategies aimed at 
      counteracting drug resistance. This review will focus on some paradigmatic 
      examples of the complex and not yet fully elucidated interaction between clinical 
      available TKIs (e.g. BCR-ABL, EGFR, VEGFR inhibitors) with the main ABC 
      transporters implicated in multidrug resistance.

AB  - Poly(D,L-lactic acid) biodegradable microspheres, loaded with the drugs cisplatin 
      and/or sorafenib tosylate, were prepared, characterized and studied. Degradation 
      of the microspheres, and release of cisplatin and/or sorafenib tosylate from 
      them, were investigated in detail. Incubation of the drug-carrying microspheres 
      in phosphate buffered saline (pH=7.4) revealed slow degradation. Nevertheless, 
      significant release of cisplatin and sorafenib tosylate from microspheres loaded 
      with both drugs was apparent in vitro; this can be attributed to their porous 
      structure. Supernatants from microspheres loaded with both drugs showed strong 
      toxic effects on cells (i.e. endothelial cells, fibroblast cells and Renca tumor 
      cells) and potent anti-angiogenic effect in the matrigel endothelial tube assay. 
      In vivo anti-tumor effects of the microspheres were also observed, in a Renca 
      tumor mouse model. The poly(D,L-lactic acid) microspheres containing both 
      cisplatin and sorafenib tosylate revealed highest therapeutic efficacy, probably 
      demonstrating that combined local administration of cisplatin and sorafenib 
      tosylate synergistically inhibits tumor growth in situ. In conclusion, this study 
      demonstrates the applicability of biodegradable poly(D,L-lactic acid) 
      microspheres loaded with cisplatin and sorafenib tosylate for local drug delivery 
      as well as the potential of these microspheres for future use in transarterial 
      chemoembolization.

AB  - This study aimed to develop sorafenib loaded magnetic microspheres for the 
      treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. To achieve this goal, superparamagnetic 
      iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) were synthesised and encapsulated in alginate 
      microspheres together with an antineoplastic agent, sorafenib. In the study, 
      firstly SPIONs were synthesised and characterised by dynamic light scattering, 
      energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Then, 
      alginate-SPIONs microspheres were developed, and further characterised by 
      electron spin resonance spectrometer and vibrating sample magnetometer. Besides 
      the magnetic properties of SPIONs, alginate microspheres with SPIONs were also 
      found to have magnetic properties. The potential use of microspheres in 
      hyperthermia treatment was then investigated and an increase of about 4°C in the 
      environment was found out. Drug release studies and cytotoxicity tests were 
      performed after sorafenib was encapsulated into the magnetic microspheres. 
      According to release studies, sorafenib has been released from microspheres for 
      8 h. Cytotoxicity tests showed that alginate-SPION-sorafenib microspheres were 
      highly effective against cancerous cells and promising for cancer therapy.

TI  - Baicalin Enhanced Oral Bioavailability of Sorafenib in Rats by Inducing Intestine 
      Absorption.
PG  - 761763
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2021.761763 [doi]
LID - 761763
AB  - Background: Sorafenib (SOR) is an oral, potent, selective, irreversible epidermal 
      growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) used as the 
      first-line therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Baicalin (BG) is 
      used as adjuvant therapy for hepatitis, which accounts for the leading cause of 
      the development of HCC, and is commonly coadministered with SOR in clinic. The 
      purpose of the current study was to characterize the pharmacokinetic changes of 
      SOR and the potential mechanism when SOR is administered concomitantly with BG in 
      rats for single and multiple doses. Methods: Parallel randomized pharmacokinetic 
      studies were performed in rats which received SOR (50 mg/kg, i.g.) alone or 
      coadministered with BG (160 mg/kg, i.g.) for single and multiple doses (7 days). 
      Plasma SOR levels were quantified by ultra-performance liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Rat liver microsomes (RLMs) 
      which isolated from their livers were analyzed for CYP3A and SOR metabolism 
      activities. The inhibitory effect of BG on the metabolism of SOR was also 
      assessed in pooled human liver microsomes (HLMs). The effects of BG on the 
      intestine absorption behaviors of SOR were assessed in the in situ single-pass 
      rat intestinal perfusion model. Results: Coadministration with BG (160 mg/kg, 
      i.g.) for single or multiple doses significantly increased the C(max), AUC(0-t), 
      and AUC(0-∞) of orally administered SOR by 1.68-, 1.73-, 1.70-fold and 2.02-, 
      1.65-, 1.66- fold in male rats and by 1.85-, 1.68-, 1.68-fold and 1.57-, 1.25-, 
      1.24- fold in female rats, respectively (p < 0.01 or p < 0.05). In vitro 
      incubation assays demonstrated that there were no significant differences of K 
      (m) , V (max) , and CL (int) of 1-OH MDZ and SOR N-oxide in RLMs between control 
      and multiple doses of BG-treated groups. BG has no obvious inhibitory effects on 
      the metabolism of SOR in HLMs. In comparison with SOR alone, combining with BG 
      significantly increased the permeability coefficient (P (eff) ) and absorption 
      rate constant (K (a) ) of the SOR in situ single-pass rat intestinal perfusion 
      model. Conclusion: Notably enhanced oral bioavailability of SOR by combination 
      with BG in rats may mainly account for BG-induced SOR absorption. A greater 
      understanding of potential DDIs between BG and SOR in rats makes major 
      contributions to clinical rational multidrug therapy in HCC patients. Clinical 
      trials in humans and HCC patients need to be further confirmed in the subsequent 
      study.

TI  - Sorafenib enhances pemetrexed cytotoxicity through an autophagy-dependent 
      mechanism in cancer cells.
PG  - 4955-67
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-11-0898 [doi]
AB  - Pemetrexed (ALIMTA, Lilly) is a folate antimetabolite that has been approved by 
      the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of non-small cell lung 
      cancer and has been shown to stimulate autophagy. In the present study, we sought 
      to further understand the role of autophagy in response to pemetrexed and to test 
      if combination therapy could enhance the level of toxicity through altered 
      autophagy in tumor cells. The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib (Nexavar, Bayer), 
      used in the treatment of renal and hepatocellular carcinoma, suppresses tumor 
      angiogenesis and promotes autophagy in tumor cells. We found that sorafenib 
      interacted in a greater than additive fashion with pemetrexed to increase 
      autophagy and to kill a diverse array of tumor cell types. Tumor cell types that 
      displayed high levels of cell killing after combination treatment showed elevated 
      levels of AKT, p70 S6K, and/or phosphorylated mTOR, in addition to class III 
      receptor tyrosine kinases such as platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta 
      and VEGF receptors, known in vivo targets of sorafenib. In xenograft and in 
      syngeneic animal models of mammary carcinoma and glioblastoma, the combination of 
      sorafenib and pemetrexed suppressed tumor growth without deleterious effects on 
      normal tissues or animal body mass. Taken together, the data suggest that 
      premexetred and sorafenib act synergistically to enhance tumor killing via the 
      promotion of a toxic form of autophagy that leads to activation of the intrinsic 
      apoptosis pathway, and predict that combination treatment represents a future 
      therapeutic option in the treatment of solid tumors.

TI  - Oral targeted therapy dose adaptation in older patients with cancer: A real-life 
      French cohort.
PG  - 3370-3377
LID - 10.1111/bcp.15285 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Oral targeted therapies (OTTs) are widely used for cancer 
      management. However, there is no consensus on OTT dose adaptation in older 
      patients with cancer. METHODS: This noninterventional, retrospective study was a 
      real-life assessment of dose adaptation for six OTTs (afatinib, everolimus, 
      palbociclib, pazopanib, sorafenib and sunitinib), at baseline and during 
      treatment, and the reasons for the changes, in ≥70-year-old patients treated 
      between February 2016 and August 2019. Data were compared with univariate models 
      fitted with all variables. RESULTS: Among the 986 patients treated with OTT, the 
      group of ≥70-year-old patients (n = 122) received afatinib (15.6%), everolimus 
      (14.8%), palbociclib (50.8%), pazopanib (9.8%), sorafenib (5.8%) or sunitinib 
      (3.2%). At baseline, the prescribed OTT dose was adapted (reduction) in 29% of 
      ≥70-year-old patients (35/122). These 35 patients were significantly older (mean 
      age 80 vs 74 years, P < .001), and more frequently had a performance status score 
      ≥2 (P < .01) than the other patients (n = 87). In the standard dose group, higher 
      toxicity grades (P = .18) and subsequent dose reduction (41% of patients, 36/87) 
      tended to be more frequent compared with the baseline adapted dose group (26%, 
      9/35, P = .1). At the study end, 53% of patients in the whole cohort (65/122) 
      were taking a lower dose than the recommended one. CONCLUSION: At OTT initiation, 
      dose was adapted in 29% of older adults with cancer, rarely after a formal 
      oncogeriatric evaluation (6.5% of all patients). In the absence of 
      recommendations, clinical studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
      of baseline OTT dose reduction in older adults with cancer.

TI  - Phase Ib Study of Enzalutamide with or Without Sorafenib in Patients with 
      Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - e1825-e1836
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2020-0521 [doi]
AB  - LESSONS LEARNED: Androgen receptor as assessed by immunohistochemistry is 
      expressed in a high proportion of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
      Enzalutamide at 160 mg orally daily is safe and tolerable in patients with 
      advanced HCC but has no single-agent antitumor activity. Enzalutamide, a CYP3A4 
      inducer, at a standard dose of 160 mg reduces the exposure of sorafenib, a CYP3A4 
      substrate. Enzalutamide and sorafenib is safe and tolerable in patients with 
      advanced HCC, but the addition of enzalutamide to sorafenib did not enhance the 
      antitumor activity of sorafenib. BACKGROUND: Androgen receptor (AR) interference 
      is deleterious to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in preclinical models. METHODS: 
      This is a multicenter, phase Ib study of enzalutamide ± sorafenib in patients 
      with advanced HCC. In part 1, a 3 + 3 dose de-escalation design with expansion 
      established the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of enzalutamide in patients in 
      whom sorafenib treatment had failed. In part 2, a 3 + 3 dose escalation with 
      expansion established the safety of enzalutamide with sorafenib in 
      treatment-naive patients with HCC. Secondary objectives included objective 
      response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), 
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and determination of AR expression by 
      immunohistochemistry. A 7-day run-in with sorafenib alone in part 2 allowed 
      assessment of the impact of enzalutamide on sorafenib pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: 
      In part 1, 16 patients received enzalutamide 160 mg daily. No dose-limiting 
      toxicity (DLT) occurred; 1 patient required dose reduction. Responses were not 
      observed; median PFS and OS were 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6-3.6) and 
      7 (95% CI: 3.6 to not reached [NR]) months, respectively. In part 2, patients 
      received sorafenib 400 mg daily (4) or twice a day (8) both with enzalutamide at 
      the recommended phase II dose-no DLTs were observed. ORR was 10% (95% CI: 
      0.3-44.5), and median PFS and OS were 2.9 (95% CI: 1.6 to NR) and 6.7 (95% CI: 
      4.6 to NR) months, respectively. Enzalutamide reduced sorafenib exposure by 60%. 
      Tumor AR expression did not associate with outcome. CONCLUSION: Enzalutamide is 
      ineffective in HCC; further development is not supported by this study.

AB  - This study aimed to design the effective formulation of sorafenib (SF) to enhance 
      the oral drug absorption. Three liposomal formulations of SF were prepared 
      including uncoated liposome (SF-Lip), glycol chitosan-coated liposome 
      (GC-SF-Lip), and Eudragit S100-glycol-chitosan coated liposome (SGC-SF-Lip). All 
      formulations showed a narrow size distribution with a high encapsulation 
      efficiency. Both GC-SF-Lip and SGC-SF-Lip exhibited good stability at acidic and 
      neutral pHs without any significant drug leakage, while SF-Lip appeared to be 
      unstable at pH 1.2. In the case of double coated SGC-SF-Lip, its size changed 
      significantly at pH 7.4, due to the dissolution of Eudragit S100 coating layer 
      into the surrounding medium. Compared to SF solution, all liposomal formulations 
      demonstrated a higher cellular uptake in Caco-2 cells. In particular, SGC-SF-Lip 
      displayed a lower cellular uptake than GC-SF-Lip at pH 6.5, but it achieved a 
      similar cellular uptake to GC-SF-Lip at pH 7.4. Consistently, SGC-SF-Lip was less 
      cytotoxic than GC-SF-Lip at pH 6.5, whereas it showed a comparable cytotoxicity 
      to GC-SF-Lip at pH 7.4, implying the removal of the Eudragit S100 coating layer 
      at pH 7.4. After an oral administration to rats, SGC-SF-Lip significantly 
      improved the systemic exposure of SF, where its Cmax and AUC were approximately 
      fourfold higher than the untreated drug. Collectively, SGC-SF-Lip appeared to be 
      promising to enhance the oral absorption of SF.

PG  - 682-92
AB  - Vascular disrupting agents (VDAs), or endothelial disrupting agents, attempt to 
      exploit the vascular endothelium that supplies rapidly dividing neoplasms. Unlike 
      antiangiogenesis agents (e.g. the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab; and tyrosine 
      kinase inhibitors sorafenib and sunitinib) that disrupt endothelial cell survival 
      mechanisms and the development of a new tumor blood supply, VDAs are designed to 
      disrupt the already established abnormal vasculature that supports tumors, by 
      targeting their dysmorphic endothelial cells. Tumor vascular endothelium is 
      characterized by its increased permeability, abnormal morphology, disorganized 
      vascular networks, and variable density. VDAs induce rapid shutdown of tumor 
      blood supply, causing subsequent tumor death from hypoxia and nutrient 
      deprivation. The safety profile of this class of compounds is more indicative of 
      agents that are indeed 'vascularly' active. For example, VDAs can cause: acute 
      coronary and other thrombophlebitic syndromes; alterations in blood pressure, 
      heart rate, and ventricular conduction; transient flush and hot flashes; 
      neuropathy; and tumor pain. Despite these cardiovascular concerns some patients 
      have benefited from VDAs in early clinical trials. Further drug development of 
      VDAs must include the combination of these agents with other novel biological 
      agents, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Close monitoring of patients 
      receiving VDAs for any cardiovascular toxicity is imperative.

TI  - Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Nuclear Paraspeckles: Induction in Chemoresistance 
      and Prediction for Poor Survival.
PG  - 787-801
LID - 10.33594/000000055 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the second most common 
      cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, not least due to its high 
      chemoresistance. The long non-coding RNA nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 
      1 (NEAT1), localised in nuclear paraspeckles, has been shown to enhance 
      chemoresistance in several cancer types. Since data on NEAT1 in HCC 
      chemosensitivity are completely lacking and chemoresistance is linked to poor 
      prognosis, we aimed to study NEAT1 expression in HCC chemoresistance and its link 
      to HCC prognosis. METHODS: NEAT1 expression was determined in either sensitive, 
      or sorafenib, or doxorubicin resistant HepG2, PLC/PRF/5, and Huh7 cells by qPCR. 
      Paraspeckles were detected by immunostaining of paraspeckle component 1 (PSPC1) 
      in cell culture and in a cohort of HCC patients. PSPC1 expression was correlated 
      with clinical data. The expression of transcript variants of NEAT1 and 
      transcripts encoding the paraspeckle-associated proteins was analysed in the TCGA 
      liver cancer data set. RESULTS: NEAT1 was overexpressed in all three sorafenib 
      and doxorubicin resistant cell lines. Paraspeckles were present in all 
      chemoresistant cells, whereas no signal was detected in the sensitive cells. 
      Expression of NEAT1 transcripts as well as transcripts encoding PSPC1, NONO, and 
      RBM14 was increased in tumour tissue. Expression of PSPC1, NONO, and RBM14 
      transcripts was significantly associated with poor survival, whereas NEAT1 
      expression was not. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that nuclear and 
      cytoplasmic PSPC1-positivity was significantly associated with shorter overall 
      survival of HCC patients. CONCLUSION: Our data show an induction of NEAT1 in HCC 
      chemoresistance and a high correlation of transcripts encoding 
      paraspeckle-associated proteins with poor survival in HCC. Therefore, NEAT1, 
      PSPC1, NONO, and RBM14 might be promising targets for novel HCC therapies, and 
      the paraspeckle-associated proteins might be clinical markers and predictors for 
      poor survival in HCC.

AB  - AIMS: Liver cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality worldwide. 
      Inspired by the biological structure and function of low-density lipoprotein 
      (LDL), in this study, an ApopB-100 based targeted lipid nanoparticles was 
      synthesized to improve the therapeutic efficacy in liver cancer treatment. MAIN 
      METHODS: The biological composition of ApopB is similar to LDL which can 
      effectively increase the targeting efficiency of nanoparticles in LDL receptor 
      (LDLR)-overexpressed liver tumors. KEYFINDINGS: We have demonstrated that the 
      co-administration of sorafenib (SRF) and Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) could exhibit 
      synergistic anticancer effect in HepG2 liver cancer cells. DHA produced excessive 
      cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induced greater apoptosis of cancer 
      cells. LDL-based SRF/DHA-loaded lipid nanoparticles (LD-SDN) showed remarkable 
      decrease in the cell viability compared to that of either of single drug treated 
      cancer cells. Combination of SRF+DHA resulted in predominant SubG1 proportion of 
      cells. LD-SDN exhibited the highest SubG1 (%) of cells compared to that of any of 
      the individual drugs. Most importantly, robust antitumor response and delayed 
      tumor growth was observed for LD-SDN treated xenograft tumor model. Ki67 
      proliferation index of LD-SDN (22.1 ± 5.6%) is significantly lesser compared to 
      that of either control (86.2 ± 6.9%) or SRF (75.4 ± 4.89%) or DHA (69.4 ± 6.9%). 
      SIGNIFICANCES: These data provide strong evidence that LDL-mimetic lipid 
      nanoformulations could be utilized as a biocompatible and tumor targeted platform 
      for the delivery of multiple anticancer drugs in cancer treatment.

AB  - WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT: Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor 
      with activity against B-raf, C-raf, VEGFR2, PDGFRβ and FGFR1. Sorafenib is 
      clinically approved for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The pharmacokinetics (PK) of sorafenib are highly 
      variable between subjects. Sorafenib exposure increases less than dose 
      proportionally (likely due to limited solubility). Sorafenib undergoes 
      enterohepatic recycling (EHC). WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This is the first study to 
      characterize the PK of sorafenib using a model based on sorafenib's known 
      disposition characteristics such as delayed/solubility-limited GI absorption and 
      EHC. The parameterization of the EHC model used a square wave function to 
      describe the gall bladder emptying. This study evaluated the effect of baseline 
      bodyweight, BSA, age, gender, liver function parameters, kidney function 
      parameters and genotype with respect to CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A5*3C, UGT1A9*3 and 
      UGT1A9*5 on sorafenib PK. No clinically important covariates were identified. 
      This model can be used to simulate and explore alternative dosing regimens and to 
      develop exposure-response relationships for sorafenib. AIMS: To characterize the 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of sorafenib in patients with solid tumours and to evaluate 
      the possible effects of demographic, clinical and pharmacogenetic (CYP3A4*1B, 
      CYP3A5*3C, UGT1A9*3 and UGT1A9*5) covariates on the disposition of sorafenib. 
      METHODS: PK were assessed in 111 patients enrolled in five phase I and II 
      clinical trials, where sorafenib 200 or 400 mg was administered twice daily as a 
      single agent or in combination therapy. All patients were genotyped for 
      polymorphisms in metabolic enzymes for sorafenib. Population PK analysis was 
      performed by using nonlinear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM). The final model 
      was validated using visual predictive checks and nonparametric bootstrap 
      analysis. RESULTS: A one compartment model with four transit absorption 
      compartments and enterohepatic circulation (EHC) adequately described sorafenib 
      disposition. Baseline bodyweight was a statistically significant covariate for 
      distributional volume, accounting for 4% of inter-individual variability (IIV). 
      PK model parameter estimates (range) for an 80 kg patient were clearance 8.13 l 
      h(-1) (3.6-22.3 l h(-1) ), volume 213 l (50-1000 l), mean absorption transit time 
      1.98 h (0.5-13 h), fraction undergoing EHC 50% and average time to gall bladder 
      emptying 6.13 h. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, population PK analysis was consistent with 
      known biopharmaceutical/PK characteristics of oral sorafenib. No clinically 
      important PK covariates were identified.

TI  - Does axitinib (AG-01376) have a future role in metastatic renal cell carcinoma 
      and other malignancies?
PG  - 1545-57
LID - 10.1586/era.10.134 [doi]
AB  - Axitinib (Pfizer Inc., UK) is an oral small-molecule receptor tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitor that targets angiogenesis. Axitinib has greater affinity and is a more 
      selective inhibitor of VEGF receptor 1, -2 and -3, PDGFR and c-KIT than both 
      sunitinib and sorafenib. It has encouraging efficacy and safety data in Phase II 
      trials for metastatic renal cell carcinoma and advanced thyroid cancer patients. 
      It is now being investigated in two Phase III trials in metastatic renal cell 
      carcinoma and in Phase II trials in a range of tumor types. These trials will 
      determine whether axitinib is an effective and safe antiangiogenic therapy.

TI  - Anti-proliferative actions of N'-desmethylsorafenib in human breast cancer cells.
PG  - 419-27

LID - 10.1016/j.bcp.2013.05.014 [doi]
AB  - The multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib is used for the treatment of renal and 
      hepatic carcinomas and is undergoing evaluation for treatment of breast cancer in 
      combination with other agents. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 converts sorafenib to 
      multiple metabolites that have been detected in patient plasma. However, recent 
      clinical findings suggest that combination therapy may elicit inhibitory 
      pharmacokinetic interactions involving sorafenib that increase toxicity. While 
      sorafenib N-oxide is an active metabolite, information on the anti-tumor actions 
      of other metabolites is unavailable. The present study evaluated the actions of 
      sorafenib and its five major metabolites in human breast cancer cell lines. All 
      agents, with the exception of N'-hydroxymethylsorafenib N-oxide, decreased ATP 
      formation in four breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MCF-7 and 
      T-47D). Prolonged treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with N'-desmethylsorafenib, 
      N'-desmethylsorafenib N-oxide and sorafenib (10 μM, 72 h) produced small 
      increases in caspase-3 activity to 128-139% of control. Sorafenib and its 
      metabolites, again with the exception of N'-hydroxymethylsorafenib N-oxide, 
      impaired MEK/ERK signaling in MDA-MB-231 cells and modulated the expression of 
      cyclin D1 and myeloid cell leukemia sequence-1, which regulate cell viability. 
      When coadministered with doxorubicin (0.5 or 1 μM), sorafenib and 
      N'-desmethylsorafenib (25 μM) produced greater effects on ATP production than 
      either treatment alone. Thus, it emerges that, by targeting the MEK/ERK pathway, 
      multiple sorafenib metabolites may contribute to the actions of sorafenib in 
      breast cancer. Because N'-desmethylsorafenib is not extensively metabolized and 
      does not inhibit major hepatic CYPs, this metabolite may have a lower propensity 
      to precipitate pharmacokinetic drug interactions than sorafenib.

AB  - Globally, one in six deaths is reported due to cancer suggesting the critical 
      need for development of advanced treatment regimens. In this study, solid lipid 
      nanoparticles (SLN) were prepared and appended with polyethylene glycol 
      (PEGylated) galactose and a multikinase inhibitor sorafenib (SRFB) was used as 
      chemotherapeutic drug, for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The 
      nanoparticles were evaluated for in-vitro and in-vivo performances to showcase 
      the targeting efficiency and therapeutic benefits of the sorafenib loaded ligand 
      conjugated nanoparticles (GAL-SSLN). When compared with SRFB or Sorafenib loaded 
      SLN, GAL-SSLN showed superior cytotoxicity and apoptosis in HepG2 (human 
      hepatocellular carcinoma cells). In addition, in-vivo pharmacokinetics and real 
      time biodistribution studies in BALB/c mice showed that the surface conjugation 
      of nanoparticles with galactose resulted in better pharmacokinetic performance 
      and targeted delivery of the nanoparticles to liver. Results indicated that 
      GAL-SSLN showed promising attributes in terms of targeting sorafenib to liver and 
      therapeutic efficacy.

TI  - Bioactivity Evaluation of a Novel Formulated Curcumin.
LID - 10.3390/nu11122982 [doi]
LID - 2982
AB  - Curcumin has been used as a traditional medicine and/or functional food in 
      several cultures because of its health benefits including anticancer properties. 
      However, poor oral bioavailability of curcumin has limited its oral usage as a 
      food supplement and medical food. Here we formulated curcumin pellets using a 
      solid dispersion technique. The pellets had the advantages of reduced particle 
      size, improved water solubility, and particle porosity. This pellet form led to 
      an improvement in curcumin's oral bioavailability. Additionally, we used the 
      C-Map and Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) Unified 
      Environment (CLUE) gene expression database to determine the potential biological 
      functions of formulated curcumin. The results indicated that, similar to 
      conventional curcumin, the formulated curcumin acted as an NF-κB pathway 
      inhibitor. Moreover, ConsensusPathDB database analysis was used to predict 
      possible targets and it revealed that both forms of curcumin exhibit similar 
      biological functions, including apoptosis. Biochemical characterization revealed 
      that both the forms indeed induced apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
      cell lines. We concluded that the formulated curcumin increases the oral 
      bioavailability in animals, and, as expected, retains characteristics similar to 
      conventional curcumin at the cellular level. Our screening platform using big 
      data not only confirms that both the forms of curcumin have similar mechanisms 
      but also predicts the novel mechanism of the formulated curcumin.

AB  - CDK8 is a transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinase and considered as a potential 
      target in colon cancer therapeutics. Here, a novel selective CDK8 inhibitor was 
      identified against colon cancer in vivo. Specifically, based on the structural 
      information of the sorafenib-bound CDK8 structure, a series of novel 
      2-amino-pyridine derivatives were designed, synthesized, and evaluated. Among 
      them, compound 29 showed strong inhibitory activity against CDK8 with an IC(50) 
      value of 46 nM and favorable selectivity. And there is an apparent interaction 
      between the endogenous or overexpressed CDK8 and biotinylated-29. This compound 
      exhibited antiproliferation potency on colon cancer cell lines with a high CDK8 
      expression level, suppressed the activation of WNT/β-catenin and transcriptional 
      activity of the TCF family, and induced G1 phase arrested in HCT-116 cells. In 
      addition, this compound showed potent activity against sorafenib-resistant 
      HCT-116 cells. What's more, it exhibited low toxicity and suitable 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles and showed preferable antitumor effects in vivo.

      inhibitors--review of assay methodologies and perspectives.
PG  - 803-34
LID - 10.1002/bmc.3370 [doi]
AB  - The introduction of small-molecule tyrosine kinase VEGFR2 (vascular endothelial 
      growth factor receptor) inhibitors has added another dimension in the treatment 
      of several oncology indications as they offer a unique mechanism. The VEGFR2 
      inhibitors have demonstrated superior benefits in treating certain types of 
      cancer, such as renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, as a 
      monotherapy option. Many of the approved VEGFR2 inhibitors have also shown 
      promise when used in combination with other anticancer agents. There are numerous 
      bioanalytical methods published for the analysis of VEGFR2 inhibitors in 
      preclinical and clinical samples. This review covers VEGFR2 inhibitors such as 
      sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib and JI-101. In addition to providing a 
      comprehensive review of the available methods for the above-mentioned VRGFR2 
      inhibitors, it also provides information on assays that can simultaneously 
      measure multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors, including VEGFR2 molecules. Based on 
      the review, the published methodologies using LC/MS-MS or HPLC-UV are adequate 
      for the quantification of the VEGFR2 inhibitors and can easily be established in 
      a modern day bioanalytical laboratory. The availability of a plethora of assays 
      for multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors makes it easy to analyze a panel of 
      compounds to support either therapeutic drug monitoring and/or clinical 
      pharmacokinetics.

TI  - Phase I study to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of the novel Raf 
      kinase and VEGFR inhibitor BAY 43-9006, administered for 28 days on/7 days off in 
      patients with advanced, refractory solid tumors.
PG  - 1688-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: BAY 43--9006, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor, targets 
      serine-threonine kinases and receptor tyrosine kinases, and affects the tumor and 
      vasculature in preclinical models. Based on its pharmacologic effect, it may be a 
      useful cancer treatment. This study determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
      of BAY 43-9006 in 42 patients with advanced, refractory metastatic or recurrent 
      solid tumors. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), safety, pharmacokinetics and tumor 
      response were also evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, phase I, 
      dose-escalation study, BAY 43--9,006 was administered orally in repeated cycles 
      of 35 days (28 days on/7 days off). Eight doses were investigated: from 50 mg 
      every fourth day to 600 mg twice daily. Treatment continued until unacceptable 
      toxicity, tumor progression or death. RESULTS: The MTD was 400 mg twice daily. 
      BAY 43-9006 was well tolerated, with mild to moderate toxicities; only six 
      patients discontinued study therapy due to adverse events. DLTs consisted of 
      hand-foot skin reaction in three of seven patients receiving 600 mg twice daily. 
      Stable disease was achieved in 22% of patients; median duration of stable disease 
      was 7.2 months. Consistent with its observed half-life of approximately 27 h, BAY 
      43-9, 006 accumulated on multiple dosing. Increases in exposure were less than 
      proportional to the increases in dose. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that further 
      clinical investigation of BAY 43--9006 is warranted, and suggest it could be a 
      promising future therapy for patients with cancer.

TI  - Axitinib for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
PG  - 303-11
LID - 10.2217/fon.15.322 [doi]
AB  - Renal cell carcinoma is a cancer that results from a genetic inactivation of the 
      VHL tumor suppressor gene leading to an upregulation of VEGF. Targeted therapies 
      against VEGF receptors have piqued substantial interest among clinicians and 
      researchers, and these drugs are now the standard of care in the treatment of 
      advanced renal cell carcinoma. One of these VEGF receptor inhibitors, axitinib, 
      has been shown to be a superior second-line therapy when compared with sorafenib. 
      Although axitinib has clinical activity and a manageable safety profile in 
      patients with treatment-naive metastatic renal cell carcinoma, utility in the 
      front-line setting is area of ongoing investigation. Another area of ongoing 
      research is dose titration of axitinib to achieve the maximum clinical benefit. 
      Interestingly, the axitinib-related side effect of hypertension has shown to be 
      associated with more favorable clinical outcomes. This article describes the 
      development of axitinib and discusses the current indications for clinical use in 
      the management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

TI  - Developments in metastatic pancreatic cancer: is gemcitabine still the standard?
PG  - 736-45
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v18.i8.736 [doi]
AB  - In the past 15 years, we have seen few therapeutic advances for patients with 
      pancreatic cancer, which is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in 
      the United States. Currently, only about 6% of patients with advanced disease 
      respond to standard gemcitabine therapy, and median survival is only about 6 mo. 
      Moreover, phase III trials have shown that adding various cytotoxic and targeted 
      chemotherapeutic agents to gemcitabine has failed to improve overall survival, 
      except in cases in which gemcitabine combined with erlotinib show minimal 
      survival benefit. Several meta-analyses have shown that the combination of 
      gemcitabine with either a platinum analog or capecitabine may lead to clinically 
      relevant survival prolongation, especially for patients with good performance 
      status. Meanwhile, many studies have focused on the pharmacokinetic modulation of 
      gemcitabine by fixed-dose administration, and metabolic or transport enzymes 
      related to the response and toxicity of gemcitabine. Strikingly, a phase III 
      trial in 2010 showed that, in comparison to gemcitabine alone, the FOLFIRINOX 
      regimen in patients with advanced disease and good performance status, produced 
      better median overall survival, median progression-free survival, and objective 
      response rates. This regimen also resulted in greater, albeit manageable 
      toxicity.

AB  - In recent years, targeted agents have changed the treatment landscape for 
      patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), greatly improving treatment 
      outcomes. Several targeted agents are now licensed for the treatment of 
      metastatic RCC (mRCC), and a number of new agents are under investigation. 
      Axitinib, a small molecule indazole derivative is an oral, potent multitargeted 
      tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor, which selectively inhibits vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)-1, -2, and -3 at subnanomolar 
      concentrations, in vitro. In various nonclinical models, axitinib has 
      demonstrated in vivo target modulation and antiangiogenesis. In pharmacokinetic 
      studies, axitinib administered orally with food at the proposed regimen of 5 mg 
      twice daily continuous daily dosing, is rapidly absorbed, reaching peak 
      concentrations within 2-6 hours. Axitinib is metabolized primarily in the liver 
      via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system with less than 1% of the administered drug 
      passing unchanged in the urine. The pharmacokinetics of axitinib do not appear to 
      be altered by coadministered chemotherapies, and antacids do not have a 
      clinically significant effect. However, coadministration with CYP3A4 and 1A2 
      inducers is contraindicated. In addition, proton pump inhibitors reduce the rate 
      of axitinib absorption. Increased axitinib exposure is associated with higher 
      efficacy indicated by decreased tumor perfusion and volume. In three phase II 
      clinical trials in patients with advanced RCC previously treated with cytokines, 
      chemotherapy or targeted agents, axitinib has demonstrated antitumor activity 
      with a favorable non-cumulative toxicity profile. In one study of Western 
      patients with cytokine-refractory mRCC, an objective response rate (ORR) of 44.2% 
      (95% CI 30.5, 58.7) was achieved. The median time to progression was 15.7 months 
      (95% CI 8.4, 23.4) and the median overall survival (OS) was 29.9 months (95% CI 
      20.3, not estimable). In the second study of patients with sorafenib-refractory 
      mRCC, ORR was 22.6% (95% CI 12.9, 35.0). The median progression-free survival 
      (PFS) was 7.4 months (95% CI 6.7, 11.0) and a median OS of 13.6 months (95% CI 
      8.4, 18.8) was achieved. Results from the third study in Japanese patients with 
      cytokine-refractory mRCC reported an ORR of 55% and median PFS of 12.9 months 
      (95% CI 9.8, 15.6). In the three studies, the most common adverse events reported 
      were fatigue, hypertension, hand-foot syndrome (HFS), and gastrointestinal 
      toxicity, which were generally manageable with standard medical intervention. Of 
      note, the incidence of HFS and proteinuria in the Japanese study was higher than 
      that reported in the Western study in cytokine-refractory mRCC patients. An 
      observed association between diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg and increased 
      efficacy suggests potential use as a prognostic biomarker. However, this requires 
      further investigation. Two randomized phase III clinical trials are ongoing to 
      determine the efficacy of axitinib in patients with mRCC in the first- and 
      second-line setting. These results will help to determine the place of axitinib 
      in the mRCC treatment algorithm.

AB  - Albumin-based nanomedicines are important nanoplatforms for cancer drug delivery. 
      The drugs are either physically encapsulated or covalently conjugated to albumin 
      or albumin-based nanosystems. Physical encapsulation is advantageous due to 
      requiring no chemical modification of drug molecules, but many drugs, for 
      instance, camptothecin (CPT) and curcumin (CCM), though very hydrophobic, can't 
      be loaded in or form nanoformulations with albumin. Herein, we demonstrate 
      prodrugs readily binding to proteins via iminoboronates and forming nanoparticles 
      for cancer drug delivery. CPT and CCM were functionalized with 
      2-acetylphenylboronic acid (2-APBA) to produce prodrugs CPT-SS-APBA and CCM- 
      APBA. The prodrugs bound to bovine serum albumin (BSA) via formation of 
      iminoboronates and the produced BSA/prodrug readily self-assembled into 
      well-defined nanoparticles with high loading efficiency, improved colloidal 
      stability, and much-improved pharmacokinetics. The nanoparticles effectively 
      released drugs in the intracellular acidic environment or the cytosol rich in 
      glutathione (GSH). In vivo, the nanoparticles showed enhanced anticancer efficacy 
      compared with clinically used irinotecan or sorafenib in subcutaneous 4 T1 or 
      HepG2 tumor models. This work demonstrates a versatile protein-binding prodrug 
      platform applicable to protein-based drug formulations and even antibody-drug 
      conjugates.

AB  - A bioanalytical assay for the mutated BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib was developed 
      and validated. For the quantitative assay, human plasma samples were pre-treated 
      using protein precipitation with water-acetonitrile (1/3, v/v) containing 
      sorafenib as internal standard. The extract was directly injected into the 
      chromatographic system. This system consisted of a sub-2 μm particle, 
      trifunctional bonded octadecyl silica column with isocratic elution using 0.01% 
      (v/v) of formic acid in a mixture of water and methanol. The eluate was 
      transferred into the electrospray interface with positive ionization and the 
      analyte was detected in the selected reaction monitoring mode of a triple 
      quadrupole mass spectrometer. The assay was validated in a 0.1-100 μg/ml 
      calibration range. Within day precisions were 1.6-3.2%, between day precisions 
      2.7% and 8.2% and accuracies were between 99% and 106% for the whole calibration 
      range. The drug was stable under all relevant conditions. Finally, the assay was 
      successfully used to assess drug levels in a pharmacokinetic mouse study.

PG  - 1021-1025

AB  - Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents a heterogeneous group of cancers with 
      distinct histological features, molecular alterations, prognosis, and response to 
      therapy. Target agents directed against vascular endothelial growth factor and 
      its receptor and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors have completely 
      changed the landscape of RCC. However, the rate of complete response is still 
      low, thus supporting the research of novel therapeutic agents. Area covered: The 
      authors describe the chemical features of tivozanib, its pharmacodynamic and 
      pharmacokinetic properties, and the results obtained in human phase I-III 
      clinical trials. Tivozanib received its first global approval in EU, Iceland, and 
      Norway on 28 August 2017 for the first-line treatment of adult patients with 
      advanced RCC and for adult patients who are VEGFR and mTOR inhibitor-naive 
      following disease progression after one prior treatment with cytokines. Expert 
      opinion: The US Food and Drug Administration did not approve tivozanib due to the 
      lack of a significant advantage in terms of survival compared to sorafenib. To 
      date, the role of tivozanib in the pharmaceutical landscape of mRCC appears to be 
      very limited. However, ongoing trials on the association between tivozanib and 
      immunotherapy may represent a promising strategy to be assessed in future 
      clinical trials.

TI  - Axitinib: a review in advanced renal cell carcinoma.
PG  - 1903-13
LID - 10.1007/s40265-015-0483-x [doi]
AB  - Axitinib (Inlyta(®)) is a potent, selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial 
      growth factor receptor-1, -2 and -3. This article reviews the clinical efficacy 
      and tolerability of axitinib in patients with previously-treated advanced renal 
      cell carcinoma (RCC), as well as summarizing its pharmacological properties. 
      Axitinib was effective in the second-line treatment of advanced RCC, according to 
      the results of the pivotal, phase III AXIS trial. Median progression-free 
      survival (PFS) was significantly prolonged with axitinib versus sorafenib 
      (primary endpoint; independent review committee assessment); this PFS benefit was 
      seen in patients who had received prior treatment with cytokines or sunitinib. 
      The objective response rate was also significantly higher with axitinib than with 
      sorafenib, with no significant between-group difference in median overall 
      survival. Axitinib had a manageable tolerability profile in the AXIS trial, with 
      the most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events including diarrhoea, 
      hypertension, fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea, dysphonia, hand-foot syndrome 
      and hypothyroidism. In conclusion, axitinib is an important option in 
      previously-treated patients with advanced RCC.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of redox-responsive sorafenib carrier 
      nanomicelles synthesized from poly (acryic acid) -cystamine 
      hydrochloride-D-α-tocopherol succinate.
PG  - 1729-1747
AB  - In this study, a controlled drug release system based on redox-responsive 
      nanomicelles for drug delivery was described. The system was constructed by 
      linking poly (acryic acid) (PAA) with D-α-tocopherol succinate (VES) via a 
      disulfide bond linker (ss). This amphiphilic polymer (PAAssVES) was synthesized 
      by coupling reaction and its chemical structure was confirmed by FT-IR and 
      (1)HNMR analyses. PAAssVES was found to self-assemble into nanomicelles with 
      diameter of about 130 nm, and a critical micelle concentration of about 
      6.3 μg/mL. The Sorafenib-loaded nanomicelles (SFN-NM) were almost spherical as 
      observed by transmission electron microscopy. Differential scanning calorimetry 
      analysis showed that Sorafenib (SFN) was entrapped in the micelles in an 
      amorphous or molecular state. The safety of SFN-NM was confirmed by hemolysis 
      study. The release of SFN from the nanomicelles was dependent on the 
      concentration of glutathione (GSH), with 85% of the drug being released under the 
      maximum concentration (40 mM) of GSH used. SFN-NM exhibited stronger cytotoxicity 
      than free SFN against BGC-823 cells under the same SFN concentration. 
      Furthermore, pharmacokinetics study showed that the bioavailability of SFN in rat 
      obtained by injecting the animal with SFN-NM was about 2.8-fold the 
      bioavailability of SFN obtained by injecting the animal with free SFN. Thus, the 
      redox-responsive SFN delivery system described in the current study could be 
      considered as a carrier for delivering SFN.

TI  - Transcatheter arterial embolic therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma: a 
      literature review.
PG  - 6877-86
AB  - Palliative therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) include transcatheter 
      arterial embolic therapies, radiation therapy and systemic chemotherapies such as 
      sorafenib. Conventional transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (cTACE) is the 
      golden standard for the treatment of intermediate-stage HCC, and involves the 
      administration of chemotherapuetic drugs, with or without lipiodol, by means of a 
      catheter directly to the feeding artery of the targeted tumor followed by 
      administration of embolic agents, while the concept of drug-eluting bead TACE 
      (DEB-TACE) builds on the rationale for cTACE. DEB-TACE has been demonstrated to 
      substantially improve the pharmacokinetic profile of TACE, providing levels of 
      consistency and repeatability in patients that are not available with cTACE. On 
      the other hand, the technique of radioembolization therapy for HCC involves the 
      delivery of high-dose radiation via the hepatic artery. In the present review, we 
      summarize the current status of these transcatheter arterial embolic therapies in 
      HCC.

TI  - The impact of Organic Anion-Transporting Polypeptides (OATPs) on disposition and 
      toxicity of antitumor drugs: Insights from knockout and humanized mice.

AB  - It is now widely accepted that organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs), 
      especially members of the OATP1A/1B family, can have a major impact on the 
      disposition and elimination of a variety of endogenous molecules and drugs. Owing 
      to their prominent expression in the sinusoidal plasma membrane of hepatocytes, 
      OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 play key roles in the hepatic uptake and plasma clearance of 
      a multitude of structurally diverse anti-cancer and other drugs. Here, we present 
      a thorough assessment of the currently available OATP1A and OATP1B knockout and 
      transgenic mouse models as key tools to study OATP functions in vivo. We discuss 
      recent studies using these models demonstrating the importance of OATPs, 
      primarily in the plasma and hepatic clearance of anticancer drugs such as 
      taxanes, irinotecan/SN-38, methotrexate, doxorubicin, and platinum compounds. We 
      further discuss recent work on OATP-mediated drug-drug interactions in these 
      mouse models, as well as on the role of OATP1A/1B proteins in the phenomenon of 
      hepatocyte hopping, an efficient and flexible way of liver detoxification for 
      both endogenous and exogenous substrates. Interestingly, glucuronide conjugates 
      of both the heme breakdown product bilirubin and the protein tyrosine 
      kinase-targeted anticancer drug sorafenib are strongly affected by this process. 
      The clinical relevance of variation in OATP1A/1B activity in patients has been 
      previously revealed by the effects of polymorphic variants and drug-drug 
      interactions on drug toxicity. The development of in vivo tools to study 
      OATP1A/1B functions has greatly advanced our mechanistic understanding of their 
      functional role in drug pharmacokinetics, and their implications for therapeutic 
      efficacy and toxic side effects of anticancer and other drug treatments.

TI  - The value of sorafenib trough levels in patients with advanced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma - a substudy of the SORAMIC trial.
PG  - 1028-1035
LID - 10.1080/0284186X.2020.1759826 [doi]
AB  - Background: Sorafenib for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is dose 
      adjusted by toxicity. Preliminary studies have suggested an association between 
      plasma concentrations of sorafenib and its main metabolite (M2) and clinical 
      outcomes. This study aimed to validate these findings and establish target values 
      for sorafenib trough concentrations.Methods: Patients with advanced HCC were 
      prospectively recruited within a multicenter phase II study (SORAMIC). Patients 
      with blood samples available at trough level were included for this 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy. Trough plasma concentrations of sorafenib and its 
      main metabolite (M2) were associated with sorafenib-related toxicity and overall 
      survival (OS).Results: Seventy-four patients were included with a median OS of 
      19.7 months (95% CI 16.1-23.3). Patients received sorafenib for a median of 
      51 weeks (IQR 27-62) and blood samples were drawn after a median of 25 weeks (IQR 
      10-42). Patients had a median trough concentration of 3217 ng/ml (IQR 2166-4526) 
      and 360 ng/ml (IQR 190-593) with coefficients of variation of 65% and 146% for 
      sorafenib and M2, respectively. Patients who experienced severe sorafenib-related 
      toxicity received a lower average daily dose (551 vs 730 mg/day, p = .003), but 
      showed no significant differences in sorafenib (3298 vs 2915 ng/ml, p = .442) or 
      M2 trough levels (428 vs 283 ng/ml, p = .159). Trough levels of sorafenib or M2 
      showed no significant association with OS.Conclusions: In patients with advanced 
      HCC treated with sorafenib, the administered dose, trough levels of sorafenib or 
      M2, and clinical outcomes were poorly correlated. Toxicity-adjusted dosing 
      remains the standard for sorafenib treatment.

AB  - Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients present poor prognosis. However, 
      recent years have seen the advent of several novel treatments in this setting, 
      where the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors has been investigated. Among 
      these, the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab has 
      reported unprecedented results in treatment-naive patients with unresectable 
      disease, with the recently published IMbrave150 Phase III trial showing the 
      superiority of the combination over sorafenib monotherapy, and after having 
      attended more than a decade of 'stagnation', the HCC medical community has a new 
      standard of care. Herein, we examine the development and the impact of 
      atezolizumab in advanced HCC, summarizing the mechanism of action, 
      pharmacokinetics and recent evidence from Phase I to III clinical trials.

      Scanning electron microscopy showed that cisplatin microspheres had smooth 
      surfaces, while sorafenib tosylate microspheres and cisplatin + sorafenib 
      tosylate microspheres were porous at the surface and the pits of the latter were 
      larger than those of the former. Notably, cisplatin + sorafenib tosylate 
      microspheres had a fast drug release rate compared with microspheres containing 
      one drug alone. In vitro cytotoxicity experiments and classical matrigel 
      endothelial tube assay certificated the maintaining bioactivity of cisplatin and 
      sorafenib tosylate released from the microspheres, respectively. This work 
      provides a useful approach for the fabrication of drug-eluting beads used in 
      transarterial chemoembolization.

TI  - Pharmacokinetically guided dosing of oral sorafenib in pediatric hepatocellular 
      carcinoma: A simulation study.
PG  - 2152-2160
LID - 10.1111/cts.13069 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib improves outcomes in adult hepatocellular carcinoma; however, hand foot 
      skin reaction (HFSR) is a dose limiting toxicity of sorafenib that limits its 
      use. HFSR has been associated with sorafenib systemic exposure. The objective of 
      this study was to use modeling and simulation to determine whether using 
      pharmacokinetically guided dosing to achieve a predefined sorafenib target range 
      could reduce the rate of HFSR. Sorafenib steady-state exposures (area under the 
      concentration curve from 0 to 12-h [AUC(0->12 h) ]) were simulated using 
      published sorafenib pharmacokinetics at either a fixed dosage (90 mg/m(2) /dose) 
      or a pharmacokinetically guided dose targeting an AUC(0->12 h) between 20 and 
      55 h µg/ml. Dosages were either rounded to the nearest quarter of a tablet 
      (50 mg) or capsule (10 mg). A Cox proportional hazard model from a previously 
      published study was used to quantify HFSR toxicity. Simulations showed that 
      in-target studies increased from 50% using fixed doses with tablets to 74% using 
      pharmacokinetically guided dosing with capsules. The power to observe at least 4 
      of 6 patients in the target range increased from 33% using fixed dosing with 
      tablets to 80% using pharmacokinetically guided with capsules. The expected HFSR 
      toxicity rate decreased from 22% using fixed doses with tablets to 16% using 
      pharmacokinetically guided dosing with capsules. The power to observe less than 6 
      of 24 studies with HFSR toxicity increased from 51% using fixed dosing with 
      tablets to 88% using pharmacokinetically guided with capsules. Our simulations 
      provide the rationale to use pharmacokinetically guided sorafenib dosing to 
      maintain effective exposures that potentially improve tolerability in pediatric 
      clinical trials.

AB  - The global transcription inhibitor terameprocol is being evaluated clinically as 
      an oral formulation to treat high-grade glioma. A sensitive, reliable method was 
      developed to quantitate terameprocol using LC-MS/MS to perform detailed 
      pharmacokinetic studies. Sample preparation involved protein precipitation using 
      acetonitrile. Separation of terameprocol and the internal standard, 
      Sorafenib-methyl-d3, was achieved with a Zorbax XDB C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm, 
      3.5 µm) and gradient elution over a 2-minute total analytical run time. A SCIEX 
      4500 or SCIEX 5500 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer operated in positive 
      electrospray ionization mode was used for terameprocol detection. The assay range 
      of 5-1000 ng/mL was demonstrated to be accurate (92.7-107.4%) and precise (CV ≤ 
      11.3%). A sample diluted 1:10 (v/v) was accurately quantitated. Terameprocol in 
      plasma has been proven stable for at least 20 months when stored at -70 °C. The 
      method was applied to the measurement of total plasma concentrations of 
      terameprocol in a patient with a high-grade glioma receiving a 300 mg oral dose.

TI  - Activity of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib in combination with cytarabine in 
      acute myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 893-905
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djr107 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically heterogeneous cancer 
      that frequently exhibits aberrant kinase signaling. We investigated a treatment 
      strategy combining sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor with limited single-agent 
      activity in AML, and cytarabine, a key component of AML chemotherapy. METHODS: 
      Using 10 human AML cell lines, we determined the effects of sorafenib (10 μM) on 
      antileukemic activity by measuring cell viability, proliferation, ERK1/2 
      signaling, and apoptosis. We also investigated the effects of sorafenib treatment 
      on the accumulation of cytarabine and phosphorylated metabolites in vitro. A 
      human equivalent dose of sorafenib in nontumor-bearing NOD-SCID-IL2Rγ(null) mice 
      was determined by pharmacokinetic studies using high performance liquid 
      chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection, and steady-state 
      concentrations were estimated by the fit of a one-compartment pharmacokinetic 
      model to concentration-time data. The antitumor activity of sorafenib alone (60 
      mg/kg) twice daily, cytarabine alone (6.25 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally), 
      or sorafenib once or twice daily plus cytarabine was evaluated in 
      NOD-SCID-IL2Rγ(null) mice bearing AML xenografts. RESULTS: Sorafenib at 10 μM 
      inhibited cell viability, proliferation and ERK1/2 signaling, and induced 
      apoptosis in all cell lines studied. Sorafenib also increased the cellular 
      accumulation of cytarabine and metabolites resulting in additive to synergistic 
      antileukemic activity. A dose of 60 mg/kg in mice produced a human equivalent 
      sorafenib steady-state plasma exposure of 10 μM. The more dose-intensive 
      twice-daily sorafenib plus cytarabine (n = 15) statistically significantly 
      prolonged median survival in an AML xenograft model compared with sorafenib once 
      daily plus cytarabine (n = 12), cytarabine alone (n = 26), or controls (n = 27) 
      (sorafenib twice daily plus cytarabine, median survival = 46 days; sorafenib once 
      daily plus cytarabine, median survival = 40 days; cytarabine alone, median 
      survival = 36 days; control, median survival = 19 days; P < .001 for combination 
      twice daily vs all other treatments listed). CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib in 
      combination with cytarabine resulted in strong anti-AML activity in vitro and in 
      vivo. These results warrant clinical evaluation of sorafenib with 
      cytarabine-based regimens in molecularly heterogeneous AML.

TI  - A Probiotic Spore-Based Oral Autonomous Nanoparticles Generator for Cancer 
      Therapy.
PG  - e1903793
LID - 10.1002/adma.201903793 [doi]
AB  - Spores, the dormant life forms of probiotics, can germinate to metabolically 
      active vegetative cells with the disintegration of their hydrophobic protein coat 
      in the intestinal microenvironment, which provides the possibility for the 
      formation of nanoparticles (NPs) in vivo. Inspired by the natural physiological 
      process of spores, herein, an oral autonomous NPs generator is developed to 
      overcome the spatially variable gastrointestinal tract environment and 
      multibiological barriers. Spores modified with deoxycholic acid (DA) and loaded 
      with chemotherapeutic drugs (doxorubicin and sorafenib, DOX/SOR) serve as an 
      autonomous production line of NPs, which can efficaciously protect the drugs 
      passing through the rugged environment of the stomach and furthermore can be 
      transported to the intestinal environment and colonized rapidly. Subsequently, 
      the DOX/SOR/Spore-DA NPs are produced by the autonomous NPs generator in the 
      intestinal regions based on the disintegrated hydrophobic protein and the 
      hydrophilic DA, and they can efficiently penetrate the epithelial cells via the 
      bile acid pathway, increasing basolateral drug release. In vitro and in vivo 
      studies confirm that this biological nanogenerator can autonomously produce 
      substantial NPs in the intestine, providing a promising strategy for cancer 
      therapy.

      in therapy.
PG  - 2801-2811
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S109640 [doi]
AB  - Since 2005, the approved first-line treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma 
      consists in tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting the vascular endothelial 
      growth factor receptors (VEGFRs). Axitinib is an oral second-generation TKI and a 
      potent VEGFR inhibitor with a half maximal inhibitory concentration for the VEGF 
      family receptors 10-fold lower than other TKIs. Axitinib activity in renal cell 
      carcinoma (RCC) patients has been studied in various settings and particularly as 
      second-line treatment. In this setting, axitinib with clinically based dose 
      escalation compared to sorafenib has demonstrated an improvement in 
      progression-free survival in a randomized Phase III trial leading to US Food and 
      Drug Administration approval. In the first-line setting, axitinib failed to 
      demonstrate improved efficacy over sorafenib, but the field of RCC treatment is 
      rapidly changing with novel TKIs as cabozantinib or the emergence of check point 
      inhibitors as nivolumab and the place of axitinib in therapy is therefore 
      challenged. In this review, we focus on axitinib pharmacological and clinical 
      properties in RCC patients and discuss its place in the treatment of patients 
      with RCC.

TI  - Phase I safety and pharmacokinetics of BAY 43-9006 administered for 21 days on/7 
      days off in patients with advanced, refractory solid tumours.
PG  - 1855-61
AB  - BAY 43-9006 is a novel dual-action Raf kinase and vascular endothelial growth 
      factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor that targets tumour cell proliferation and 
      tumour angiogenesis. This Phase I study was undertaken to determine the safety 
      profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), 
      pharmacokinetics, and tumour response profile of oral BAY 43-9006 in patients 
      with advanced, refractory solid tumours. BAY 43-9006 was administered daily for 
      repeated cycles of 21 days on/7 days off. A total of 44 patients were enrolled at 
      doses from 50 to 800 mg b.i.d. Pharmacokinetic profiles of BAY 43-9006 in plasma 
      were determined during the first treatment cycle. The most frequently reported 
      adverse events over multiple cycles were gastrointestinal (75%), dermatologic 
      (71%), constitutional (68%), pain (64%), or hepatic (61%) related. A MTD of 400 
      mg b.i.d. BAY 43-9006 was defined. BAY 43-9006 was absorbed rapidly; steady-state 
      conditions were reached within 7 days. BAY 43-9006 exposure increased 
      nonproportionally with increasing dose. In all, 32 patients were evaluated for 
      tumour response: 15 patients showed tumour progression, 16 patients experienced 
      stable disease (>6 months in eight patients), and one patient with renal cell 
      carcinoma achieved a partial response. BAY 43-9006 given for 21 days with 7 days 
      off treatment was safe, well tolerated, and showed antitumour activity.

TI  - Improving Drug Penetrability with iRGD Leverages the Therapeutic Response to 
      Sorafenib and Doxorubicin in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 3147-54
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-0395 [doi]
AB  - iRGD is a derivative of the integrin-binding peptide RGD, which selectively 
      increases the penetrability of tumor tissue to various coadministered substances 
      in several preclinical models. In this study, we investigated the ability of iRGD 
      to improve the delivery of sorafenib and doxorubicin therapy in hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) using established mouse models of the disease. A 
      contrast-enhanced MRI method was developed in parallel to assess the in vivo 
      effects of iRGD in this setting. We found that iRGD improved the delivery of 
      marker substances to the tumors of HCC-bearing mice about three-fold without a 
      parallel increase in normal tissues. Control peptides lacking the critical CendR 
      motif had no effect. Similarly, iRGD also selectively increased the signal 
      intensity from tumors in Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI. In terms of antitumor efficacy, 
      iRGD coadministration significantly augmented the individual inhibitory effects 
      of sorafenib and doxorubicin without increasing systemic toxicity. Overall, our 
      results offered a preclinical proof of concept for the use of iRGD 
      coadministration as a strategy to widen the therapeutic window for HCC 
      chemotherapy, as monitored by Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI as a noninvasive, clinically 
      applicable method to identify iRGD-reactive tumors.

TI  - New Approach for Treatment of Primary Liver Tumors: The Role of Quercetin.
PG  - 250-66
LID - 10.1080/01635581.2016.1145245 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver tumor (PLT), with 
      cholangiocarcinoma (CC) being the second most frequent. Glucose transporter 1 
      (GLUT-1) expression is increased in PLTs and therefore it is suggested as a 
      therapeutic target. Flavonoids, like quercetin, are GLUT-1 competitive inhibitors 
      and may be considered as potential therapeutic agents for PLTs. The objective of 
      this study was evaluation of quercetin anticancer activity in three human HCC 
      cell lines (HepG2, HuH7, and Hep3B2.1-7) and in a human CC cell line (TFK-1). The 
      possible synergistic effect between quercetin and sorafenib, a nonspecific 
      multikinase inhibitor used in clinical practice in patients with advanced HCC, 
      was also evaluated. It was found that in all the cell lines, quercetin induced 
      inhibition of the metabolic activity and cell death by apoptosis, followed by 
      increase in BAX/BCL-2 ratio. Treatment with quercetin caused DNA damage in HepG2, 
      Hep3B2.1-7, and TFK-1 cell lines. The effect of quercetin appears to be 
      independent of P53. Incubation with quercetin induced an increase in GLUT-1 
      membrane expression and a consequent reduction in the cytoplasmic fraction, 
      observed as a decrease in (18)F-FDG uptake, indicating a GLUT-1 competitive 
      inhibition. The occurrence of synergy when sorafenib and quercetin were added 
      simultaneously to HCC cell lines was noticed. Thus, the use of quercetin seems to 
      be a promising approach for PLTs through GLUT-1 competitive inhibition.

TI  - Sorafenib metabolism is significantly altered in the liver tumor tissue of 
      hepatocellular carcinoma patient.
PG  - e96664
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0096664 [doi]
LID - e96664
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib, the drug used as first line treatment for hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC), is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4-mediated oxidation 
      and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) 1A9-mediated 
      glucuronidation. Liver diseases are associated with reduced CYP and UGT 
      activities, which can considerably affect drug metabolism, leading to drug 
      toxicity. Thus, understanding the metabolism of therapeutic compounds in patients 
      with liver diseases is necessary. However, the metabolism characteristic of 
      sorafenib has not been systematically determined in HCC patients. METHODS: 
      Sorafenib metabolism was tested in the pooled and individual tumor hepatic 
      microsomes (THLMs) and adjacent normal hepatic microsomes (NHLMs) of HCC patients 
      (n = 18). Commercial hepatic microsomes (CHLMs) were used as a control. In 
      addition, CYP3A4 and UGT1A9 protein expression in different tissues were measured 
      by Western blotting. RESULTS: The mean rates of oxidation and glucuronidation of 
      sorafenib were significantly decreased in the pooled THLMs compared with those in 
      NHLMs and CHLMs. The maximal velocity (Vmax) of sorafenib oxidation and 
      glucuronidation were approximately 25-fold and 2-fold decreased in the pooled 
      THLMs, respectively, with unchanged Km values. The oxidation of sorafenib in 
      individual THLMs sample was significantly decreased (ranging from 7 to 67-fold) 
      than that in corresponding NHLMs sample. The reduction of glucuronidation in 
      THLMs was observed in 15 out of 18 patients' samples. Additionally, the level of 
      CYP3A4 and UGT1A9 expression were both notably decreased in the pooled THLMs. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib metabolism was remarkably decreased in THLMs. This result 
      was associated with the down regulation of the protein expression of CYP3A4 and 
      UGT1A9.

TI  - Efficacy of lenvatinib in treating thyroid cancer.
PG  - 1683-91
LID - 10.1080/14656566.2016.1206078 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Radioiodine [RAI]-resistant advanced and progressive differentiated 
      thyroid cancer [DTC], although rare, constitutes a real challenge as its 
      prognosis is poor and available therapeutic options, until now, have been 
      limited. Discovery of a crucial role of distinct tyrosine kinases in DTC 
      pathogenesis opened up new options in systemic treatment. Lenvatinib is an oral 
      potent multi kinase inhibitor [MKI] of different growth factor receptors 
      including VEGFR1/Flt-1, VEGFR2/KDR, VEGFR3, FGFR1,2,3,4, PDGFR-β as well as RET 
      and KIT signaling networks. Its activity against RAI-refractory DTC was 
      demonstrated in clinical studies fulfilling evidence-based medicine [EBM] 
      criteria. The drug showed acceptable tolerance and manageable toxicity. AREAS 
      COVERED: published results of phase II and III studies and other reports 
      evaluated the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in DTC and in medullary thyroid 
      carcinoma. EXPERT OPINION: Currently there are two different MKIs, lenvatinib and 
      sorafenib, which have demonstrated effectiveness against RAI-refractory DTC. 
      However, to date, the question of which drug should be chosen for first line 
      treatment remains open. The other question: when to start the treatment seems to 
      be no less important. Whether disease progression, even by RECIST, is enough to 
      initiate a therapy or tumor burden also plays an important role? EBM study, to 
      resolve these issues, is our task for the nearest future.

TI  - Influence of OATP1B1 Function on the Disposition of Sorafenib-β-D-Glucuronide.
PG  - 271-279
LID - 10.1111/cts.12458 [doi]
AB  - The oral multikinase inhibitor sorafenib undergoes extensive UGT1A9-mediated 
      formation of sorafenib-β-D-glucuronide (SG). Using transporter-deficient mouse 
      models, it was previously established that SG can be extruded into bile by ABCC2 
      or follow a liver-to-blood shuttling loop via ABCC3-mediated efflux into the 
      systemic circulation, and subsequent uptake in neighboring hepatocytes by 
      OATP1B-type transporters. Here we evaluated the possibility that this unusual 
      process, called hepatocyte hopping, is also operational in humans and can be 
      modulated through pharmacological inhibition. We found that SG transport by 
      OATP1B1 or murine Oatp1b2 was effectively inhibited by rifampin, and that this 
      agent can significantly increase plasma levels of SG in wildtype mice, but not in 
      Oatp1b2-deficient animals. In human subjects receiving sorafenib, rifampin 
      acutely increased the systemic exposure to SG. Our study emphasizes the need to 
      consider hepatic handling of xenobiotic glucuronides in the design of drug-drug 
      interaction studies of agents that undergo extensive phase II conjugation.

TI  - Evolution of systemic therapy of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 6437-41
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) commonly occurs in hepatitis B endemic areas, 
      especially in Asian countries. HCC is highly refractory to cytotoxic 
      chemotherapy. This resistance is partly related to its tumor biology, 
      pharmacokinetic properties, and both intrinsic and acquired drug resistance. 
      There is no convincing evidence thus far that systemic chemotherapy improves 
      overall survival in advanced HCC patients. Other systemic approaches, such as 
      hormonal therapy and immunotherapy, have also disappointing results. Recently, 
      encouraging results have been shown in using sorafenib in the treatment of 
      advanced HCC patients. In this review, we concisely summarize the evolution of 
      developments in the systemic therapy of advanced HCC.

TI  - A phase I study of sorafenib in combination with S-1 plus cisplatin in patients 
      with advanced gastric cancer.

LID - 10.1007/s10120-013-0247-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib inhibits several receptor tyrosine kinases involved in 
      tumor progression and angiogenesis. S-1, an oral fluorouracil antitumor drug, 
      plus cisplatin (CDDP) is the standard regimen for advanced gastric adenocarcinoma 
      (AGC) in Japan. The purpose of this phase I study was to evaluate the safety, 
      pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of sorafenib in combination with S-1 
      plus CDDP. METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed previously untreated 
      AGC were evaluated for eligibility and treated with sorafenib (400 mg bid, days 
      1-35), S-1 (40 mg/m(2) bid, days 1-21), and CDDP (60 mg/m(2), day 8). Treatment 
      was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
      Pharmacokinetics for sorafenib, 5-FU, and CDDP were investigated in cycle 1. 
      RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of the 
      study treatment. No specific or serious adverse event was newly reported in this 
      study. Five patients had partial response and 8 had stable disease as the best 
      response. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed no significant differences in the 
      exposures of sorafenib when administered alone or in combination with S-1 and 
      CDDP. CONCLUSIONS: The present phase I study demonstrates the acceptable toxicity 
      and preliminary efficacy of combined treatment with S-1, CDDP, and sorafenib.

TI  - In vitro to in vivo comparison of the substrate characteristics of sorafenib 
      tosylate toward P-glycoprotein.
PG  - 1341-6
LID - 10.1124/dmd.110.032052 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib (Nexavar) is a novel oral Raf kinase and vascular endothelial growth 
      factor receptor inhibitor. Most anticancer drugs are substrates for ATP-binding 
      cassette efflux pumps especially for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). To evaluate the 
      influence of P-gp on the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib substrate properties for 
      this transporter were investigated. Therefore, permeability of sorafenib across 
      Caco-2 and P-gp-overexpressing cells was determined. To determine the in vivo 
      relevance of these in vitro findings, pharmacokinetics of sorafenib in 
      mdr1a/1b(-/-) and wild-type (WT) mice was studied. Sorafenib is highly permeable 
      and exhibits a slight efflux across Caco-2 cells. In P-gp-overexpressing cells, a 
      small concentration-dependent efflux was observed, which was completely blocked 
      by the addition of ivermectin. In mdr1a/1b(-/-) and WT mice, unchanged compound 
      represented by far the majority of radioactivity in plasma. After intravenous and 
      oral administration, brain/plasma concentration ratios in mdr1a/1b(-/-) mice were 
      1.3- to 1.5-fold higher than those in WT mice. However, after intravenous or oral 
      administration, plasma concentrations were similar in both mouse strains. In 
      conclusion, sorafenib is highly permeable and a weak P-gp substrate in vitro. 
      These findings were confirmed by the small factor of 1.3 to 1.5 observed for the 
      brain/plasma ratios in mdr1a/1b(-/-) versus WT mice in vivo. Based on these in 
      vitro and in vivo results, it is unlikely that P-gp has a major effect on the 
      plasma concentrations of sorafenib in humans. Because of the high permeability 
      and low P-gp-mediated transport, sorafenib might be able to cross the blood-brain 
      barrier and target tumors within the brain.

TI  - Phase I study of sorafenib in Japanese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 159-65
AB  - Sorafenib is an orally active multikinase inhibitor that targets serine and 
      threonine, and tyrosine kinases that are involved in tumor-cell signal 
      transduction and tumor angiogenesis. This phase I trial was conducted to evaluate 
      the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and preliminary efficacy of sorafenib in 
      Japanese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with underlying liver 
      dysfunction. Patients with unresectable HCC, Child-Pugh status A or B, and 
      adequate organ functions were treated. A single dose of sorafenib was 
      administered, followed by a 7-day wash-out period, after which patients received 
      either sorafenib 200 mg (cohort 1) or 400 mg (cohort 2) twice daily. The PK were 
      investigated after a single dose and during steady state. The efficacy was 
      evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. A total of 27 
      patients were evaluated for PK, safety, and efficacy. Although both area under 
      the concentration-time curve for 0-12 h and maximal concentration at steady state 
      were slightly lower in Child-Pugh B patients than in Child-Pugh A patients, the 
      difference was not considered to be clinically relevant. Common adverse drug 
      events included elevated lipase, amylase, rash or desquamation, diarrhea, and 
      hand-foot skin reaction. A dose-limiting toxicity of hand-foot skin reaction was 
      observed in one patient (cohort 2). Among the 24 patients evaluable for tumor 
      response, one patient (4%) achieved a partial response, 20 (83%) had stable 
      disease, and three (13%) had progressive disease. Sorafenib demonstrated a 
      favorable tolerability and safety profile in Japanese HCC patients. Moreover, 
      promising preliminary antitumor activity has been observed. Finally, there were 
      no clinically relevant differences in PK between Child-Pugh A and B patients.

AB  - The high rate of negative clinical trials and failed drug development programs 
      calls into question the use of preclinical testing as currently practiced. An 
      important issue for the in vitro testing of agents that have advanced into the 
      clinic is the use of clinically irrelevant concentrations in reports making 
      claims for anticancer activity, as illustrated by publications for sorafenib, 
      vorinostat, and metformin. For sorafenib, high protein binding leads to a 
      dichotomy between concentrations active in the 10% serum conditions commonly used 
      for in vitro testing and concentrations active in plasma. Failure to recognize 
      this distinction leads to inappropriate claims of activity for sorafenib based on 
      the micromolar concentrations commonly used for in vitro testing in low serum 
      conditions. For vorinostat and metformin, results using in vitro concentrations 
      higher than those achievable in patients are reported despite the availability of 
      publications describing human pharmacokinetic data for each agent. We encourage 
      journal editors and reviewers to pay greater attention to clinically relevant 
      concentrations when considering reports that include in vitro testing of agents 
      for which human pharmacokinetic data are available. Steps taken to more carefully 
      scrutinize activity claims based on in vitro results can help direct researchers 
      away from clinically irrelevant lines of research and toward lines of research 
      that are more likely to lead to positive clinical trials and to improved 
      treatments for patients with cancer.

TI  - Use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with metastatic kidney cancer 
      receiving haemodialysis: a retrospective Italian survey.
PG  - 692-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2012.10946.x [doi]
AB  - What's known on the subject? and What does the study add? Sunitinib and sorafenib 
      are orally administered multikinase inhibitors approved for the treatment of 
      advanced RCC. The limited pharmacokinetics data on sunitinib and sorafenib 
      suggest that haemodialysis does not significantly alter plasma concentrations. In 
      this retrospective study we define the safety and efficacy of tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors in patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC) and end-stage renal disease 
      requiring haemodialysis. Even though the retrospective nature of this survey and 
      the relatively small sample size represent major limitations, these data indicate 
      that treatment with sunitinib and sorafenib in this cohort of patients is 
      feasible with no unexpected toxicity and good efficacy, results similar to those 
      in the general population of patients with mRCC. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the 
      safety and efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with 
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and end-stage renal disease requiring 
      haemodialysis (HD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 2006 and December 2010, 24 
      patients undergoing HD were treated with sunitinib and/or sorafenib for mRCC in 
      14 Italian institutions. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of these 
      patients to evaluate the administered doses of TKIs, treatment-related toxicities 
      and the clinical response to therapy. RESULTS: Sunitinib was administered at 50 
      mg daily for 4-6 weeks in six patients, 37.5 mg daily for 4-6 weeks in seven 
      patients (one patient subsequently increased the dose to 50 mg daily), 25 mg 
      daily for 4-6 weeks in two patients and 12.5 mg daily for 4-6 weeks in one 
      patient. Among the eight patients treated with sorafenib, four patients received 
      800 mg daily (400 mg every 12 h), three patients 400 mg daily and one patient 200 
      mg daily with a continuous schedule. The estimated median progression-free and 
      overall survival periods of this cohort of patients were 10.3 months and 22.6 
      months, respectively. With regard to tolerability and safety, no unexpected 
      adverse events were registered and no grade 4 haematological or 
      non-haematological toxicities were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Sunitinib and sorafenib 
      treatment is not contraindicated in patients with mRCC undergoing HD. The outcome 
      of this patient population is similar to that observed in patients with normal 
      renal function treated with TKIs. These results merit further confirmation by a 
      larger prospective trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has undergone 
      significant changes over the past 3 years after a long period of relative 
      stagnation. A better understanding of the biology of the tumor led to the 
      discovery of molecular targeted therapies resulting in significant improvement in 
      outcome for this common malignancy. OBJECTIVES: A review of new drugs, both 
      established and investigational, at present used in the treatment of RCC is 
      provided in this article. METHODS: A comprehensive free-text search of all 
      available published literature including but not limited to, Medline, Scopus, 
      American Society of Clinical Oncology presentations, National Comprehensive 
      Cancer Network guidelines and information available through other national and 
      international scientific organizations was carried out during the preparation of 
      this manuscript. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted therapy in RCC is a prime example of 
      successful translational research. Continuing clinical and preclinical research 
      in drug development holds promise for further advances in this area.

TI  - Phase I/II study of sorafenib in combination with erlotinib for recurrent 
      glioblastoma as part of a 3-arm sequential accrual clinical trial: NABTC 05-02.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptors 
      (EGFRs) and their downstream signaling pathways such as the 
      Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway play important roles in 
      glioblastoma (GBM). This study investigated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and 
      efficacy of sorafenib (Ras/Raf/MAPK inhibitor) in combination with erlotinib 
      (EGFR inhibitor) for treatment of recurrent GBMs. METHODS: Patients with 
      recurrent GBM were eligible. A novel sequential accrual trial design was used, 
      where patients were sequentially accrued into separate treatment arms in phase I 
      and phase II investigations to optimize recruitment efficiency. In phase I, a 
      standard 3 + 3 format was used to identify dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), 
      determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and investigate pharmacokinetics. Phase 
      II followed a 2-stage design with the primary endpoint being 6-month 
      progression-free survival (PFS6). RESULTS: Sixteen patients were recruited for 
      phase I, and the MTD was determined to be sorafenib 200 mg twice daily and 
      erlotinib 100 mg once daily. DLTs include Grade 3 hypertension, Grade 3 elevated 
      liver transaminases, and Grade 4 elevated lipase. While erlotinib did not affect 
      sorafenib levels, sorafenib reduced erlotinib levels. In phase II, 3 of 19 stage 
      1 participants were progression free at 6 months. This did not meet the 
      predetermined efficacy endpoint, and the trial was terminated. CONCLUSION: This 
      study identified the MTD and DLTs for sorafenib and erlotinib combination therapy 
      for recurrent GBMs; however, efficacy data did not meet the primary endpoint. 
      This study also demonstrates the feasibility of a novel sequential accrual 
      clinical trial design that optimizes patient recruitment for multiarm studies, 
      which is particularly effective for multicenter clinical trials.

TI  - Binding kinetics in drug discovery - A current perspective.
PG  - 21-47
AB  - The impact of target binding kinetics (BK) on the clinical performance of 
      therapeutic agents is presently a topic of intense debate in drug discovery. 
      While retrospective studies suggest that BK is a differentiating parameter in 
      marketed medicines, it is yet unclear how this information could be used to 
      prioritize drug candidates during lead optimization. Motivated by the question 
      whether BK can be understood and rationally optimized, we review the most 
      relevant literature in the field, with special focus on selected examples from 
      our organization. First we discuss structure-kinetic relationships (SKR), and how 
      they can be influenced by factors such as conformational changes, molecular 
      flexibility, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobicity, water molecules and (reversible-) 
      covalent bonds. We then introduce the methodologies currently used for the 
      investigation of BK parameters, briefly commenting on their strengths, weaknesses 
      and future trends. Finally, we present our current perspective on the integration 
      of BK in the drug discovery process, aiming to stimulate further thoughts on this 
      important subject.

TI  - The Raf kinase inhibitor BAY 43-9006 reduces cellular uptake of platinum 
      compounds and cytotoxicity in human colorectal carcinoma cell lines.
PG  - 129-36
AB  - Raf kinase plays a central role in oncogenic signaling and acts as a downstream 
      effector of Ras in the extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) kinase pathway. BAY 
      43-9006 (BAY) is a novel signal transduction inhibitor that prevents tumor cell 
      proliferation and angiogenesis through blockade of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway at the 
      level of Raf kinase and the receptor tyrosine kinases vascular endothelial growth 
      factor receptor-2 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta. The present 
      study evaluates the effects of combining BAY and platinum derivatives on human 
      colorectal cancer cells using different incubation protocols. Our data show that 
      the combination of oxaliplatin or cisplatin with BAY results in marked antagonism 
      irrespective of the used application schedule. Furthermore, BAY abrogates the 
      cisplatin-induced G2 arrest as well as the G1 arrest induced by oxaliplatin. BAY 
      alone arrests cancer cells in their current cell cycle phase and affects cell 
      cycle regulative genes. Specifically, BAY reduced the protein expression of 
      p21Cip1 as well as cyclin D1, and inhibits the expression of cdc2 (cdk1). 
      Utilizing atom absorption spectrometry, BAY significantly reduced cellular uptake 
      of platinum compounds and thereby the generation of DNA adducts. Taken together, 
      co-incubation with BAY results in reduced cellular uptake of platinum compounds 
      and consecutively reduced generation of DNA adducts, and eventually decreased 
      cellular cytotoxicity in human colorectal cancer cells. Our results indicate that 
      the Raf kinase inhibitor BAY 43-9006 might also directly or indirectly interact 
      with platinum transporter proteins in vitro.

TI  - Porphyrin Based 2D-MOF Structures as Dual-Kinetic Sorafenib Nanocarriers for 
      Hepatoma Treatment.
LID - 10.3390/ijms222011161 [doi]
LID - 11161
AB  - The existing clinical protocols of hepatoma treatment require improvement of drug 
      efficacy that can be achieved by harnessing nanomedicine. Porphyrin-based, 
      paddle-wheel framework (PPF) structures were obtained and tested as dual-kinetic 
      Sorafenib (SOR) nanocarriers against hepatoma. We experimentally proved that 
      sloughing of PPF structures combined with gradual dissolving are effective 
      mechanisms for releasing the drug from the nanocarrier. By controlling the PPF 
      degradation and size of adsorbed SOR deposits, we were able to augment SOR 
      anticancer effects, both in vitro and in vivo, due to the dual kinetic behavior 
      of SOR@PPF. Obtained drug delivery systems with slow and fast release of SOR 
      influenced effectively, although in a different way, the cancer cells 
      proliferation (reflected with EC50 and ERK 1/2 phosphorylation level). The in 
      vivo studies proved that fast-released SOR@PPF reduces the tumor size 
      considerably, while the slow-released SOR@PPF much better prevents from lymph 
      nodes involvement and distant metastases.

TI  - Phase ib of sorafenib in combination with everolimus in patients with advanced 
      solid tumors, selected on the basis of molecular targets.
PG  - 344-5
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2013-0335 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Molecular alterations of the PI3K and Ras pathways often occur in 
      human cancer. In this trial, the pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and activity of two 
      drugs inhibiting these pathways-everolimus and sorafenib-were investigated. 
      METHODS: Thirteen patients with progressing solid tumors were treated with 
      everolimus and sorafenib, according to a 3+3 scheme. Patients were selected on 
      the basis of immunohistochemical expression of tumor molecular targets, including 
      phospho-AKT, -p70S6K, and -ERK1/2. RESULTS: The daily recommended dose identified 
      was 2.5 mg of everolimus and 600 mg of sorafenib. Dose-limiting toxicities 
      included grade 3 asthenia and hand-foot skin reaction. No grade 4 adverse events 
      were observed. The most frequent grade 3 toxicities were hypophosphatemia 
      (30.8%), alanine aminotransferase level increase, asthenia, and anorexia (14%). 
      No pharmacokinetic interactions were identified between everolimus and sorafenib. 
      Of 12 evaluable patients, we observed 2 partial responses, with greater than 10% 
      shrinkage in an additional 5 patients. Objective responses were observed in one 
      patient with a thymoma and in one patient with a lung adenocarcinoma. Tumor 
      shrinkage that did not qualify as a partial response was seen in an abdominal 
      leiomyosarcoma and in adenoid cystic carcinomas. CONCLUSION: The combination of 
      everolimus and sorafenib is safe. The tumor activity observed in different tumor 
      types could be the result of the combined action of these drugs as well as the 
      molecular selection of the treated population. Further research is warranted to 
      better investigate drugs simultaneously blocking the PI3K and the Ras pathways 
      and to refine patient selection.

TI  - Prognostic and Predictive Factors in Patients with Advanced HCC and Elevated 
      Alpha-Fetoprotein Treated with Ramucirumab in Two Randomized Phase III Trials.
PG  - 2297-2305
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-21-4000 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Ramucirumab is an effective treatment for patients with advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC) and baseline alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥400 ng/mL. 
      We aimed to identify prognostic and predictive factors of response to ramucirumab 
      in patients with aHCC with AFP ≥400 ng/mL from the phase III REACH and REACH-2 
      randomized trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with aHCC, Child-Pugh class A 
      with prior sorafenib treatment were randomized in REACH and REACH-2 (ramucirumab 
      8 mg/kg or placebo, biweekly). Meta-analysis of individual patient-level data 
      (pooled population) from REACH (AFP ≥400 ng/mL) and REACH-2 was performed. A drug 
      exposure analysis was conducted for those with evaluable pharmacokinetic data. To 
      identify potential prognostic factors for overall survival (OS), multivariate 
      analyses were performed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. To 
      define predictors of ramucirumab benefit, subgroup-by-treatment interaction terms 
      were evaluated. RESULTS: Of 542 patients (316 ramucirumab, 226 placebo) analyzed, 
      eight variables had independent prognostic value associated with poor outcome 
      (geographical region, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score ≥1, 
      AFP >1,000 ng/mL, Child-Pugh >A5, extrahepatic spread, high 
      neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, high alkaline phosphatase and aspartate 
      aminotransferase). Ramucirumab survival benefit was present across all subgroups, 
      including patients with very aggressive HCC [above median AFP; HR: 0.64; 95% 
      confidence interval (CI): 0.49-0.84] and nonviral aHCC (HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 
      0.40-0.79). While no baseline factor was predictive of a differential OS benefit 
      with ramucirumab, analyses demonstrated an association between high drug 
      exposure, treatment-emergent hypertension (grade ≥3), and increased ramucirumab 
      benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Ramucirumab provided a survival benefit irrespective of 
      baseline prognostic covariates, and this benefit was greatest in patients with 
      high ramucirumab drug exposure and/or those with treatment-related hypertension.

TI  - A randomized phase I clinical and biologic study of two schedules of sorafenib in

AB  - Sorafenib is a small molecule inhibitor of RAF kinase, VEGFR-2, c-KIT, and FLT3. 
      In this randomized phase I study, eligible patients had relapsed/refractory acute 
      myeloid leukemia (AML), and one prior induction regimen, or were age >65 with 
      untreated myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or secondary AML. Sorafenib was given 
      orally for 28 days (cont) or 14 days (int) every 4 weeks at three dose levels 
      (100, 200, and 400 mg BID); 300 mg cont was also tested. Forty-two patients were 
      enrolled (median age 71 [37-82]; prior chemotherapy: 22). Dose-limiting toxicity 
      (DLT) was: 100 mg BID: 0/7 patients; 200 mg BID: 2/12 patients; 400 mg BID: 1/17 
      patients. Sorafenib 400 mg cont was not tolerated in this population: 6/8 
      received <14 days of treatment due to toxicity; no DLT was seen with 300 mg cont. 
      One CR was seen in a patient with AML with FLT3-ITD. Flow cytometry studies 
      suggest that sorafenib inhibits ERK phosphorylation via c-KIT. The recommended 
      phase II dose in AML is 300 mg BID continuously, and testing in combination and 
      in FLT3-ITD AML is warranted.

      the application in clinical practice? A pilot study.
PG  - 335

AB  - Pharmacokinetics and dose-finding studies on sorafenib were conducted on 
      heterogeneous groups of patients with solid tumors. Portal hypertension, gut 
      motility impairment and altered bile enterohepatic circulation may explain 
      different sorafenib toxicological profile in cirrhotic patients. This study 
      evaluated sorafenib plasma concentration in a homogeneous group of cirrhotic 
      patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sorafenib concentrations were 
      determined by liquid chromatography in 12 consecutive patients. Data have been 
      evaluated by the generalized estimating equations method (p value statistical 
      level was set at α = 0.05). (1) There were not significant differences between 
      sorafenib concentrations in patients who tolerate the full dose versus patients 
      with reduced dose due to toxicity; (2) the average sorafenib concentrations 
      measured 3 h after the morning dosing were lower than those measured 12 h after 
      the evening dosing (p = 0.005); (3) sorafenib concentrations decrease overtime 
      (p < 10(-4)); (4) it has been found an association between the development of 
      severe adverse reactions and sorafenib concentrations (p < 10(-5)). The 
      relationship between dose and concentration of sorafenib in HCC patients is poor 
      and not clinically predictable, confirming the variability both in the maximum 
      tolerated dose and in plasma concentrations. Several factors may influence the 
      pharmacokinetics in patients with liver disease. This may explain the 
      inter-patient variability of concentrations and the lack of differences in 
      concentration at different dosages. It could be interesting to extend the series 
      of HCC patients to enhance information on the kinetics of the drug; furthermore, 
      to establish a threshold of plasma sorafenib concentrations to predict severe 
      adverse reactions would be clinically useful.

TI  - Sorafenib exposure decreases over time in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 2046-9
LID - 10.1007/s10637-011-9764-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intra-patient variability in sorafenib pharmacokinetics has been 
      poorly investigated to date. We hypothesized that sorafenib clearance could 
      decrease over time, as seen with imatinib. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sorafenib plasma 
      concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography, every 2 weeks, in 
      consecutive hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with sorafenib. Sorafenib 
      dose-normalized area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was determined from 
      a population pharmacokinetics model, and its kinetics was analyzed in order to 
      identify possible alterations of exposure over time. RESULTS: Fifteen 
      hepatocellular carcinoma patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, in whom sorafenib 
      dosing remained unchanged from initiation of treatment to disease progression, 
      were eligible for this analysis. Sorafenib AUC significantly decreased over time: 
      the median AUC during the third month of treatment was lower than that observed 
      after one month of treatment (43.0 vs. 60.3 mg/L.h, p = 0.008). Most importantly, 
      median sorafenib AUC at the time of progression was almost two-fold lower than 
      that observed after one month of therapy (33.2 vs. 60.3 mg/L.h, p = 0.007). These 
      findings suggest an induction of expression of efflux transporters in the gut 
      wall, or an induction of sorafenib metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with 
      progressive disease in whom exposure markedly decreased from baseline, sorafenib 
      dose escalation could be considered, aiming to restore an adequate drug exposure 
      and possibly anti-tumor activity.

TI  - Overcoming sorafenib evasion in hepatocellular carcinoma using CXCR4-targeted 
      nanoparticles to co-deliver MEK-inhibitors.
PG  - 44123
LID - 10.1038/srep44123 [doi]
LID - 44123
AB  - Sorafenib is a RAF inhibitor approved for several cancers, including 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Inhibition of RAF kinases can induce a 
      dose-dependent "paradoxical" upregulation of the downstream mitogen-activated 
      protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in cancer cells. It is unknown whether 
      "paradoxical" ERK activation occurs after sorafenib therapy in HCC, and if so, if 
      it impacts the therapeutic efficacy. Here, we demonstrate that RAF inhibition by 
      sorafenib rapidly leads to RAF dimerization and ERK activation in HCCs, which 
      contributes to treatment evasion. The transactivation of RAF dimers and ERK 
      signaling promotes HCC cell survival, prevents apoptosis via downregulation of 
      BIM and achieves immunosuppression by MAPK/NF-kB-dependent activation of PD-L1 
      gene expression. To overcome treatment evasion and reduce systemic effects, we 
      developed CXCR4-targeted nanoparticles to co-deliver sorafenib with the MEK 
      inhibitor AZD6244 in HCC. Using this approach, we preferentially and efficiently 
      inactivated RAF/ERK, upregulated BIM and down-regulated PD-L1 expression in HCC, 
      and facilitated intra-tumoral infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. These 
      effects resulted in a profound delay in tumor growth. Thus, this nano-delivery 
      strategy to selectively target tumors and prevent the paradoxical ERK activation 
      could increase the feasibility of dual RAF/MEK inhibition to overcome sorafenib 
      treatment escape in HCC.

AB  - Despite various applications of kinase inhibitors in oncology and inflammatory 
      diseases, the emergence of resistance still remains the major barrier to achieve 
      long-term remission in cancer treatment. With the aim of overcoming the 
      resistance induced by type IIB BRaf (V600E) selective inhibitor vemurafenib, and 
      further ameliorating the antiproliferative activity, a novel type IIA Pan-Raf 
      inhibitors Ia-Io based on pyrrolo[2,3-d] pyrimidine scaffold were designed and 
      evaluated in this work. Herein, we tried to improve the cellular potency of the 
      target compounds by increasing their solubility. Among them, Il, with the 
      solubility of 0.107 mg/mL, demonstrated favorable cellular activity against 
      vemurafenib-resistant carcinoma cells including BRaf(WT) phenotypic melanoma 
      SK-MEL-2 and BRaf(V600E) phenotypic colorectal cancer HT-29 cell lines. Based on 
      the well solubility, Il exhibited good metabolic stability compared to sorafenib 
      and showed favorable pharmacokinetic profiles in rats. As for the biological 
      mechanism research, Il had the similar P-ERK kinase inhibitory activity in A375 
      and SK-Mel-2 cells as our previously lead P-2. Il may become a good candidate 
      compound to overcome the resistance associated with vemurafenib.

      greatest growing incidence in this decade. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor 
      for the treatment of progressive radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated 
      thyroid cancer (DTC), while the off-target toxicity effect is usually 
      inconvenient for patients taking. METHODS: In this study, hollow mesoporous 
      silica nanoparticles (HMSNs) with transferrin modification (Tf-HMSNs) were loaded 
      with sorafenib (sora@Tf-HMSNs) to help targeted delivery of sorafenib. Due to the 
      biocompatible Tf shell, Tf-HMSNs exhibited excellent bio-compatibility and 
      increased intracellular accumulation, which improved the targeting capability to 
      cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Sora@Tf-HMSNs treatment exhibited the 
      strongest inhibition effect of res-TPC-1 cells and res-BCPAP cells compared with 
      sora@HMSNs and sorafenib groups and induced more cancer cell apoptosis. Finally, 
      Western blot analysis was conducted to check the expression of RAF/MEK/ERK 
      signaling pathway after sorafenib encapsulated Tf-HMSNs treatment. CONCLUSION: 
      Overall, sora@Tf-HMSNs can significantly increase the effective drug 
      concentration in cancer cells and thus enhance the anticancer effect, which are 
      expected to be promising nanocarriers to deliver anticancer drugs for effective 
      and safe therapy for RAI-refractory DTC.

AB  - The anticancer activity of novel thiazolidine-2,4-diones was evaluated against 
      HepG2, HCT-116, and MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 was the most sensitive cell line to the 
      cytotoxicity of the new derivatives. In particular, compounds 18, 12, 17, and 16 
      were found to be the most potent derivatives over all the tested compounds 
      against the cancer cell lines HepG2, HCT116, and MCF-7, with IC(50) 
       = 9.16 ± 0.9, 8.98 ± 0.7, 5.49 ± 0.5 µM; 9.19 ± 0.5, 8.40 ± 0.7, 6.10 ± 0.4 µM; 
      10.78 ± 1.2, 8.87 ± 1.5, 7.08 ± 1.6 µM; and 10.87 ± 0.8, 9.05 ± 0.7, 
      7.32 ± 0.4 µM, respectively. Compounds 18 and 12 have nearly the same activities 
      as sorafenib (IC(50)  = 9.18 ± 0.6, 5.47 ± 0.3, and 7.26 ± 0.3 µM, respectively), 
      against HepG2 cells, but slightly lower activity against HCT116 cells and 
      slightly higher activity against the MCF-7 cancer cell line. Also, these 
      compounds displayed lower activities than doxorubicin against HepG2 and HCT-116 
      cells but higher activity against MCF-7 cells (IC(50)  = 7.94 ± 0.6, 8.07 ± 0.8, 
      and 6.75 ± 0.4 µM, respectively). In contrast, compounds 17 and 16 exhibited 
      lower activities than sorafenib against HepG2 and HCT116 cells, but nearly 
      equipotent activity against the MCF-7 cancer cell line. Also, these compounds 
      displayed lower activities than doxorubicin against the three cell lines. All the 
      synthesized derivatives 7-18 were evaluated for their inhibitory activities 
      against VEGFR-2. The tested compounds displayed high to medium inhibitory 
      activity, with IC(50) values ranging from 0.17 ± 0.02 to 0.27 ± 0.03 µM. 
      Compounds 18, 12, 17, and 16 potently inhibited VEGFR-2 at IC(50) values of 
      0.17 ± 0.02, 0.17 ± 0.02, 0.18 ± 0.02, and 0.18 ± 0.02 µM, respectively, which 
      are nearly more than half of that of the IC(50) value for sorafenib 
      (0.10 ± 0.02 µM).

AB  - Making sure the change of nuclear LC3 distribution in the autophagy of acute 
      myeloid leukemia (AML) cell and finding out the regulation mechanism may lead to 
      a breakthrough for killing AML cells. Western blots were performed to assess the 
      expression of autophagy proteins. Changes in the LC3 distribution were monitored 
      by immunofluorescence assays together with western blots, and the expression 
      levels of Sirt1, DOR, Beclin1, HMGB1, and AMPK mRNA were detected via fluorescent 
      quantitative PCR. The effects of Sirt1 and DOR on cell proliferation and survival 
      were analyzed by MTT, flow cytometry, and western blotting assays. We found that 
      treating AML cells with Ara-c or Sorafenib resulted in autophagy enhancement, and 
      when autophagy was enhanced, nuclear LC3 moved into the cytoplasm. Notably, when 
      autophagy was inhibited by blocking the nuclear LC3 shift, the cytotoxicity of 
      drugs was enhanced. Our results also identified Sirt1 and DOR as regulatory 
      molecules for the observed nuclear LC3 shift, and these molecules further 
      affected the expression of Beclin1, HMGB1, and AMPK. Our results suggest the 
      distribution of nuclear LC3 can be a novel way for further studying death of AML 
      cells,and the regulatory molecules may be new targets for treating AML.

TI  - Phase II study of sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 4293-300
AB  - PURPOSE: This phase II study of sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor that 
      targets Raf kinase and receptor tyrosine kinases, assessed efficacy, toxicity, 
      pharmacokinetics, and biomarkers in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
      patients. METHODS: Patients with inoperable HCC, no prior systemic treatment, and 
      Child-Pugh (CP) A or B, received continuous, oral sorafenib 400 mg bid in 4-week 
      cycles. Tumor response was assessed every two cycles using modified WHO criteria. 
      Sorafenib pharmacokinetics were measured in plasma samples. Biomarker analysis 
      included phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase (pERK) in 
      pretreatment biopsies (immunohistochemistry) and blood-cell RNA expression 
      patterns in selected patients. RESULTS: Of 137 patients treated (male, 71%; 
      median age, 69 years), 72% had CP A, and 28% had CP B. On the basis of 
      independent assessment, three (2.2%) patients achieved a partial response, eight 
      (5.8%) had a minor response, and 46 (33.6%) had stable disease for at least 16 
      weeks. Investigator-assessed median time to progression (TTP) was 4.2 months, and 
      median overall survival was 9.2 months. Grade 3/4 drug-related toxicities 
      included fatigue (9.5%), diarrhea (8.0%), and hand-foot skin reaction (5.1%). 
      There were no significant pharmacokinetic differences between CP A and B 
      patients. Pretreatment tumor pERK levels correlated with TTP. A panel of 18 
      expressed genes was identified that distinguished "nonprogressors" from 
      "progressors" with an estimated 100% accuracy. CONCLUSION: Although single-agent 
      sorafenib has modest efficacy in HCC, the manageable toxicity and mechanisms of 
      action support a role for combination regimens with other anticancer agents.

AB  - Changes in the uptake of many drugs by the target cells may dramatically affect 
      the pharmacological response. Thus, downregulation of SLC22A1, which encodes the 
      organic cation transporter type 1 (OCT1), may affect the response of healthy 
      hepatocytes and liver cancer cells to cationic drugs, such as metformin and 
      sorafenib, respectively. Moreover, the overall picture may be modified to a 
      considerable extent by the preexistence or the appearance during the pathogenic 
      process of genetic variants. Some rare OCT1 variants enhance transport activity, 
      whereas other more frequent variants impair protein maturation, plasma membrane 
      targeting or the function of this carrier, hence reducing intracellular active 
      drug concentrations. Here, we review current knowledge of the role of OCT1 in 
      modern liver pharmacology, which includes the use of cationic drugs to treat 
      several diseases, some of them of great clinical relevance such as diabetes and 
      primary liver cancer (cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma). We 
      conclude that modern pharmacology must consider the individual evaluation of OCT1 
      expression/function in the healthy liver and in the target tissue, particularly 
      if this is a tumor, in order to predict the lack of response to cationic drugs 
      and to be able to design individualized pharmacological treatments with the 
      highest chances of success.

      benefit: A systematic review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Innovative strategies to fully exploit the antitumor activity of 
      multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are urgently needed. Higher 
      concentrations of TKIs at their target site, i.e. intratumorally, may lead to 
      broader kinase inhibition, which might be essential for the optimal suppression 
      of tumor growth and induction of apoptosis. To reach these higher intratumoral 
      concentrations, without encountering dose limiting toxicity, alternative TKI 
      dosing strategies employing higher daily and high intermittent doses have been 
      studied. In this systematic review, we evaluated the current clinical evidence to 
      support (intermittent) high TKI dosing regimens. METHODS: A systematic review was 
      conducted in the following databases: PubMed®, EMBASE® and Cochrane Library©, to 
      evaluate efficacy of alternatively scheduled high-dosed regimen (a higher dose in 
      a regular daily schedule than registered or a higher dose in an alternative 
      intermittent schedule) of TKIs in (haemato-)oncology. Data were extracted 
      independently by two authors according to predefined criteria. Extracted data 
      were tabulated to summarize key findings. RESULTS: Out of twenty studies that met 
      the inclusion criteria, thirteen investigated higher daily dose schedules of 
      either afatinib, axitinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, imatinib, sorafenib, and 
      sunitinib. Five of these studies included pharmacokinetic analyses, reporting 
      marginal higher maximum drug concentrations (C(max)) in plasma (1.3-4-fold 
      higher) compared to the standard dose schedules. Seven clinical trials 
      investigated intermittent high-dose schedules requiring treatment breaks, with 
      the following TKIs: afatinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatinib, sorafenib, and 
      sunitinib. Six of these included pharmacokinetic results, all reporting higher 
      (2-21-fold) C(max) in plasma compared to the standard daily dose schedule, with 
      manageable toxicity. No data on tumor concentrations were presented. Data on the 
      efficacy outcomes were limited due to small sample size, study designs, phase 1 
      population and heterogeneous tumor types. CONCLUSIONS: Early phase clinical 
      studies show that high-dose intermittent TKI-treatment schedules can lead to an 
      increased C(max) compared to standard (low-dose) daily administration with 
      manageable toxicity. These higher concentrations are assumed to reflect higher 
      intratumoral concentrations. Further investigation of the potential improvement 
      in clinical benefit of a high-dose intermittent strategy with multitargeting TKIs 
      is warranted.

TI  - Targeting the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 in acute myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 2176-85
LID - 10.1038/leu.2012.114 [doi]
AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogenous disease with multiple 
      signaling pathways contributing to its pathogenesis. A key driver of AML is the 
      FMS-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 (FLT3). Activating mutations in FLT3, 
      primarily the FLT3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), are associated with 
      decreased progression-free and overall survival. Identification of the importance 
      of FLT3-ITD and the FLT3 pathway in the prognosis of patients with AML has 
      stimulated efforts to develop therapeutic inhibitors of FLT3. Although these 
      inhibitors have shown promising antileukemic activity, they have had limited 
      efficacy to date as single agents and may require use in combination with 
      cytotoxic chemotherapies. Here, we review clinical and preclinical results for 
      the clinically mature FLT3 inhibitors currently in development. We conclude that 
      multitargeted FLT3 inhibitors may have more utility earlier in the course of 
      disease, when in vitro evidence suggests that AML cells are less dependent on 
      FLT3 signaling, perhaps because of upregulation of multiple other signaling 
      pathways. More potent agents may have greater utility in relapsed and heavily 
      pretreated patients, in whom high levels of circulating FLT3 ligand may 
      necessitate use of an agent with a very favorable pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic 
      profile. Novel combination regimens are also discussed.

TI  - Tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib decreases 111In-girentuximab uptake in 
      patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.
PG  - 242-7
LID - 10.2967/jnumed.113.131110 [doi]
AB  - Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic 
      clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Although TKIs have demonstrated good 
      clinical efficacy, the lack of complete responses, the chronic nature of the 
      treatment, and the side effects are clear disadvantages. An interesting new 
      approach in the treatment of clear cell RCC is antibody-mediated therapy with the 
      chimeric anti-carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) antibody girentuximab (cG250). As the 
      results of several girentuximab trials become available, the question arises of 
      whether TKI treatment can be combined with girentuximab-based therapy. In this 
      study, we assessed the effect of the widely used TKI sorafenib on the 
      tumor-targeting potential of (111)In-labeled girentuximab. METHODS: 
      (111)In-girentuximab imaging was performed on 15 patients suspected of having a 
      renal malignancy, with surgery being part of their treatment plan. Of these, 10 
      patients were treated in a neoadjuvant setting with sorafenib (400 mg orally 
      twice daily). Five patients received treatment during 1 wk, and 5 patients 
      received treatment during 4 wk. In both sorafenib-treated groups, baseline and 
      posttreatment tumor targeting of (111)In-girentuximab were compared. Surgery was 
      performed 3 d after the last image acquisition. Five additional patients were 
      included as a control group and had only a single (111)In-girentuximab injection 
      and scintigraphy without any treatment. Distribution of (111)In-girentuximab was 
      determined scintigraphically ex vivo in a 1-cm lamella of the resected tumorous 
      kidney. Expression of CAIX and of the vascular marker CD31 was determined 
      immunohistochemically on specimens of both tumor and normal kidney tissue. 
      RESULTS: Treatment with sorafenib resulted in a marked decrease of 
      (111)In-girentuximab uptake in the tumor in clear cell RCC patients, especially 
      in the group treated for 4 wk (mean change in both sorafenib-treated groups, 
      -38.4%; range, +9.1% to -79.4%). Immunohistochemical analysis showed markedly 
      reduced CD31 expression and vessel density in the sorafenib-treated groups but no 
      differences in CAIX expression between the sorafenib-treated groups and the 
      nontreated patients. CONCLUSION: Treatment with sorafenib resulted in a treatment 
      duration-dependent significantly decreased uptake of (111)In-girentumab in clear 
      cell RCC lesions. These results indicate that the efficacy of antibody-mediated 
      treatment or diagnosis modalities is hampered by TKI treatment.

TI  - New 2,4-disubstituted-2-thiopyrimidines as VEGFR-2 inhibitors: Design, synthesis, 
      and biological evaluation.
PG  - e1900089
LID - 10.1002/ardp.201900089 [doi]
AB  - A new series of 2,4-disubstituted-2-thiopyrimidines 6a-t, 9a, and 9b was 
      efficiently designed and synthesized as antiangiogenic and cytotoxic agents. 
      Compounds 6j, 6l, and 6d showed IC(50) values of 1.23, 3.78, and 3.84 μM, 
      respectively, against the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 
      (VEGFR-2). Most of the synthesized 2-thiouracils showed antiproliferative 
      activity against the HepG2 cell line (hepatocellular carcinoma) in the micromolar 
      range, for instance, 9b, 6l, 6m, 6n, and 6j displayed IC(50)  = 7.92, 8.35, 8.51, 
      9.59, and 13.06 μM, respectively, relative to sorafenib (III; IC(50) 
       = 10.99 μM). Also, compounds 6j, 9a, 6m, and 6s (IC(50)  = 15.21, 16.96, 17.68, 
      and 18.15 μM, respectively) are the most potent compounds against the UO-31 cell 
      line. Further evaluation of the effect of the synthesized candidates on VEGFR-2 
      in the HepG2 cell line demonstrated that compounds 6j and 6l exhibit VEGFR-2 
      inhibitory activity of 87% and 84%, respectively, relative to sorafenib (III; 
      92%). In silico docking of the synthesized hits into the binding site of VEGFR-2 
      showed their ability to perform the main binding interactions with the key amino 
      acids in the binding site. Studying the in silico predicted ADME (absorption, 
      distribution, metabolism, and excretion) parameters for the synthesized 
      thiouracils demonstrated that they have favorable pharmacokinetic and 
      drug-likeness properties. These results demonstrate that the 2,4-disubstituted 
      thiouracils 6 and 9 have not only favorable antiangiogenic and antiproliferative 
      activity but also satisfy the criteria required for the development of orally 
      bioavailable drugs. Consequently, they represent a biologically active scaffold 
      that should be further optimized for future discovery of potential hits.

TI  - The role of the key autophagy kinase ULK1 in hepatocellular carcinoma and its 
      validation as a treatment target.

AB  - Although macroautophagy/autophagy is involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
      initiation and development and has been identified as a mechanism of HCC therapy 
      resistance, the role of ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) in HCC 
      remains unclear. Here, we report that both knockdown and knockout of ULK1 
      inhibited human HCC cell proliferation and invasion, and Ulk1 deletion abrogated 
      tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model. Furthermore, ULK1 ablation in 
      combination with sorafenib significantly inhibited HCC progression compared with 
      sorafenib treatment alone or vehicle control. To identify candidate ULK1 
      inhibitors, we used a structure-based virtual docking approach to screen 3428 
      compounds. Among these compounds, XST-14 showed the highest affinity for the ULK1 
      protein and specifically blocked ULK1 kinase activity. Moreover, the Lys46, Tyr94 
      and Asp165 amino acid residues of ULK1 were required for its binding to XST-14 
      according to molecular docking and mutagenesis experiments. Functional assays 
      revealed that XST-14 blocked autophagy and subsequently induced apoptosis and 
      inhibited growth in HCC cells. More importantly, XST-14 acted synergistically 
      with sorafenib to attenuate HCC progression by inhibiting sorafenib-induced 
      autophagy activation both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, XST-14 was well 
      tolerated and exhibited favorable drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic properties 
      and low toxicity in mice. In summary, our study determined that ULK1 may 
      represent a new therapeutic target for HCC and that targeting ULK1 in combination 
      with sorafenib treatment may serve as a promising interventional strategy for 
      treating HCC. Abbreviations: 3MA: 3-methyladenine; ADV: AutoDock Vina; ATP:

TI  - Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of [(11)C]CEP-32496 in Nude Mice Bearing BRAF(V600E) 
      Mutation-Induced Melanomas.

AB  - CEP-32496, also known as RXDX-105 or Agerafenib, is a new orally active inhibitor 
      for the mutated v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF(V600E)), 
      which has attracted considerable attention in clinical trials for the treatment 
      of human cancers. Here, we used carbon-11-labeled CEP-32496 ([(11)C]CEP-32496) as 
      a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer to evaluate its pharmacokinetic 
      properties and explore its potential for in vivo imaging. Following radiotracer 
      synthesis, we performed in vitro binding assays and autoradiography of 
      [(11)C]CEP-32496 in the A375 melanoma cell line and on tumor tissue sections from 
      mice harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation. These were followed by PET scans and 
      biodistribution studies on nude mice bearing subcutaneous A375 cell-induced 
      melanoma. [(11)C]CEP-32496 showed high binding affinity for BRAF(V600E)-positive 
      A375 melanoma cells and densely accumulated in the respective tissue sections; 
      this could be blocked by the BRAF(V600E) selective antagonist sorafenib and by 
      unlabeled CEP-32496. The PET and biodistribution results revealed that 
      [(11)C]CEP-32496 accumulated continuously but slowly into the tumor within a 
      period of 0 to 60 minutes postinjection in A375-melanoma-bearing nude mice. 
      Metabolite analysis showed high in vivo stability of [(11)C]CEP-32496 in plasma. 
      Our results indicate that [(11)C]CEP-32496 has excellent specificity and affinity 
      for the BRAF(V600E) mutation in vitro, while its noninvasive personalized 
      diagnostic role needs to be studied further.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Accompanied by significant improvements of modeling techniques and 
      computational methods in medical sciences, the last thirty years saw the 
      flourishing of pharmacokinetic models for applications in the pharmacometric 
      field. In particular, physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, 
      grounded on a mechanistic foundation, have been applied to explore a multiplicity 
      of aspects with possible applications in patient care and new drugs development, 
      as in the case of siRNA therapies. METHOD: This article summarizes the features 
      we recently introduced in PBPK modeling within a threeyear research project 
      funded by Italian Research Ministry. Four major points are detailed: (i) the 
      mathematical formulation of the model, which allows modulating its complexity as 
      a function of the administration route and active principle; (ii) a dedicated 
      parameter of the PBPK model quantifies the drugprotein binding, which affects the 
      active principle distribution; (iii) the gall bladder compartment and the bile 
      enterohepatic circulation process; (iv) the coupling of the pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic models to produce an overall understanding of the drug effects on 
      mammalian body. RESULTS: The proposed model is applied to two separate endovenous 
      (remifentanil) and oral (sorafenib) drug administrations. The resulting PBPK 
      simulations are consistent with the literature experimental data. Blood 
      concentration predictability is confirmed in multiple reference subjects. 
      Furthermore, in case of sorafenib administration in mice, it is possible to 
      evaluate the drug concentration in the liver and reproduce the effects of the 
      enterohepatic circulation. Finally, a preliminary application of the coupling of 
      the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models is presented and discussed.

TI  - HATT: a phase IV, single-arm, open-label study of sorafenib in Taiwanese patients 
      with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 199-208
LID - 10.1007/s12072-016-9774-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib significantly improves survival in patients with advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This phase IV study assessed sorafenib 
      efficacy/safety in Taiwanese patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh A status. 
      METHODS: All patients received 400 mg sorafenib BID. Safety, efficacy, sorafenib 
      pharmacokinetics, and Child-Pugh progression were evaluated. A hand-foot skin 
      reaction (HFSR) prevention substudy assessed HFSR incidence and grade/severity 
      and time to HFSR in 29 and 34 patients randomized to corticosteroid and 
      noncorticosteroid ointments, respectively, and in 88 nonrandomized patients. 
      RESULTS: The 151 patients included 120 (80%) male patients and 81 (54%) with 
      stage IV disease. Mean sorafenib dose was 626 mg/day, and median treatment 
      duration was 4.2 months. Median overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, 
      and time to progression (TTP) were 8.6, 2.7, and 3.8 months, respectively. 
      Disease control and response rates (partial responses only) were 48 and 6.6%, 
      respectively. Median TTP from Child-Pugh A to B/C was 88 days. Drug-related 
      adverse events (AEs) occurred in 89.4% of patients; none were new or unexpected. 
      The most frequent grade ≥3 drug-related, treatment-emergent AEs were HFSR 
      (13.2%), diarrhea (11.9%), and hypertension (6.6%). Corticosteroid ointment 
      tended to reduce the severity and incidence of all HFSR-associated parameters. 
      Pharmacokinetic exposure was unaltered by Child-Pugh progression. The final 
      pharmacokinetic model predicted 13.1 and 33.8% reductions in sorafenib exposure 
      over 6 and 12 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There was a trend of longer OS 
      and TTP in Taiwanese patients with advanced HCC compared with patients with 
      advanced HCC in the Asia-Pacific trial. Sorafenib exposure did not correlate with 
      liver function. Reduced pharmacokinetic exposure over time was unrelated to 
      reduced or interrupted dosing.

TI  - PR-104 plus sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 539-45
LID - 10.1007/s00280-011-1671-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: PR-104 is activated by reductases under hypoxia or by aldo-keto 
      reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) to form cytotoxic nitrogen mustards. Hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) displays extensive hypoxia and expresses AKR1C3. This study 
      evaluated the safety and efficacy of PR-104 plus sorafenib in HCC. METHODS: 
      Patients with advanced-stage HCC, Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, and adequate organ 
      function, were assigned to dose escalating cohorts of monthly PR-104 in 
      combination with twice daily sorafenib. The plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
      PR-104 and its metabolites were evaluated. RESULTS: Fourteen (11 men, 3 women) 
      HCC patients: median age 60 years, ECOG 0-1, received PR-104 at two dose levels 
      plus sorafenib. Six patients were treated at starting cohort of 770 mg/m(2). In 
      view of one DLT of febrile neutropenia and prolonged thrombocytopenia, a lower 
      PR-104 dose cohort (550 mg/m(2)) was added and accrued 8 patients. One patient 
      had a partial response and three had stable disease of ≥8 weeks in the 770 
      mg/m(2) cohort. Three patients at the 550 mg/m(2) had stable disease. There were 
      no differences in PK of PR-104 or its metabolites with or without sorafenib, but 
      the PR-104A AUC was twofold higher (P < 0.003) than in previous phase I studies 
      at equivalent dose. CONCLUSIONS: PR-104 plus sorafenib was poorly tolerated in 
      patients with advanced HCC, possibly because of compromised clearance of PR-104A 
      in this patient population. Thrombocytopenia mainly and neutropenia were the most 
      clinically significant toxicities and led to discontinuation of the study. PR-104 
      plus sorafenib is unlikely to be suitable for development in this setting.

TI  - Sorafenib administered using a high-dose, pulsatile regimen in patients with 
      advanced solid malignancies: a phase I exposure escalation study.
PG  - 931-940
LID - 10.1007/s00280-020-04065-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: (Pre)clinical evidence is accumulating that intermittent exposure to 
      increased doses of protein kinase inhibitors may improve their treatment benefit. 
      In this phase I trial, the safety of high-dose, pulsatile sorafenib was studied. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: High-dose sorafenib was administered once weekly in 
      exposure escalation cohorts according to a 3 + 3 design. Drug monitoring was 
      performed in weeks 1-3 and doses were adjusted to achieve a predefined target 
      plasma area under the curve (AUC)(0-12 h). The effect of low gastric pH on 
      improving sorafenib exposure was investigated by intake of the acidic beverage 
      cola. RESULTS: Seventeen patients with advanced malignancies without standard 
      treatment options were included. Once weekly, high-dose sorafenib exposure was 
      escalated up to a target AUC(0-12 h) of 125-150 mg/L/h, achieving a twofold 
      higher C(max) compared to standard continuous dosing. Dose-limiting toxicity was 
      observed in three patients: grade 3 duodenal perforation (2800 mg sorafenib), 
      grade 5 multiorgan failure (2800 mg sorafenib) and grade 5 biliary tract 
      perforation (3600 mg sorafenib). The mean difference between observed and target 
      AUC(0-12 h) was 45% (SD ± 56%) in week 1 using a fixed starting dose of sorafenib 
      compared to 2% (SD ± 32%) in week 3 as a result of drug monitoring (P = 0.06). 
      Dissolving sorafenib in cola, instead of water, did not improve sorafenib 
      exposure. Clinical benefit with stable disease as the best response was observed 
      in two patients. CONCLUSION: Treatment with high-dose, once weekly sorafenib 
      administration resulted in dose-limiting toxicity precluding dose escalation 
      above the exposure cohort of 125-150 mg/L/h. Drug monitoring was a successful 
      strategy to pursue a target exposure.

TI  - A reduction and pH dual-sensitive nanodrug for targeted theranostics in 
      hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 3485-3499
LID - 10.1039/d0bm00295j [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib (SF) is the first drug demonstrated to improve the survival of patients 
      diagnosed with advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, its 
      clinical application is limited by the poor oral bioavailability and severe side 
      effects. In this study, a multifunctional micellar nanodrug was developed for 
      simultaneous HCC-targeted delivery of SF and tumor detection with magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI). The micellar nanodrug incorporating SF and 
      superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) was prepared from a diblock 
      copolymer of monomethoxyl poly(ethylene glycol) and 
      poly(N-(2-aminoethanethiol-co-2-aminoethyldiisopropylamine) aspartamide) and then 
      decorated with anti-glypican-3 antibody (Ab(GPC3)). Owing to the small size, weak 
      positive charge and Ab(GPC3)-mediated active targeting to HCC cells, the nanodrug 
      exhibited an easy cellular uptake and enhanced tumor accumulation. The prominent 
      reduction and pH dual-sensitivity allowed the nanodrug to rapidly release SF 
      inside cancer cells via responding to the cytoplasmic glutathione and lysosomal 
      acidity. The nanodrug not only significantly improved the anticancer effects of 
      SF in hepatoma treatment but also facilitated a noninvasive tumor detection and 
      monitoring of in vivo drug delivery by MRI, which revealed its great potential as 
      a promising theranostic system.

TI  - Enhancing anti-tumor efficiency in hepatocellular carcinoma through the autophagy 
      inhibition by miR-375/sorafenib in lipid-coated calcium carbonate nanoparticles.

AB  - Sorafenib is a first-line drug for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Autophagy has 
      been shown to facilitate sorafenib resistance. miR-375 has been shown to be an 
      inhibitor of autophagy. In this study, miR-375 and sorafenib were co-loaded into 
      calcium carbonate nanoparticles with lipid coating (miR-375/Sf-LCC NPs). The 
      nanoparticles had high loading efficiency and were ∼50 nm in diameter. Besides, 
      the NPs could increase the stability and residence time of both drugs. Moreover, 
      we demonstrated that autophagy was activated in HCC cells by sorafenib but not by 
      miR-375/Sf-LCC NPs. In vitro, miR-375/Sf-LCC NPs exhibited pH-dependent drug 
      release and potent cytotoxicity. In vivo, miR-375/Sf-LCC NPs increased miR-375 
      and sorafenib uptake in tumor (2 folds compared with Lipofectamine 2000-miR-375 
      and 2-5 folds compared with free sorafenib). Furthermore, miR-375/Sf-LCC NPs 
      showed greatly enhanced therapeutic efficacy in an HCC xenograft model. These 
      findings suggest that miR-375/Sf-LCC NPs may be a promising agent for the HCC 
      therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most 
      common primary liver tumor and the third leading cause of cancer mortality 
      globally. In this manuscript, miR-375 and sorafenib were co-loaded into calcium 
      carbonate nanoparticles with lipid coating (miR-375/Sf-LCC NPs) to treat HCC. We 
      demonstrated that miR-375/Sf-LCC NPs can deliver sorafenib and miR-375 into HCC 
      cells and tumor tissues, increase drug retention time in tumor, significantly 
      inhibit autophagy and produce enhanced anti-tumor effect.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose-limiting 
      toxicity (DLT) of sorafenib (S) plus imatinib (IM) in castration-resistant 
      prostate cancer (CRPC) patients. METHODS: Refractory CRPC patients were enrolled 
      onto this 3+3 dose escalation designed study. Imatinib pharmacokinetics (PK) were 
      determined on day 15, 4 h post dose with a validated LC-MS assay. RESULTS: 
      Seventeen patients were enrolled; 10 evaluable (6 at 400 mg S qd with 300 mg IM 
      qd (DL0) and 4 at 400 mg S bid with 300 mg IM qd (DL1)); inevaluable patients 
      received <1 cycle. The median age was 73 (57-89); median prostatic serum antigen 
      was 284 ng ml(-1) (11.7-9027). Median number of prior non-hormonal therapies was 
      3 (1-12). Dose-limiting toxicities were diarrhoea and hand-foot syndrome. Maximum 
      tolerated dose was 400 mg S and 300 mg IM both daily. No biochemical responses 
      were observed. Two patients had stable disease by RECIST. Median time to 
      progression was 2 months (1-5). Median OS was 6 months (1-30+) with 3/17 patients 
      (17%) alive at 21 months median follow-up. Ten patients had PK data suggesting 
      that S reduced IM clearance by 55%, resulting in 77% increased exposure (P=0.005; 
      compared with historical data). CONCLUSION: This is the first report showing that 
      S+IM can be administered in CRPC at a dose of 400 mg S and 300 mg IM, daily.

TI  - Multikinase Inhibitors Induce Cutaneous Toxicity through OAT6-Mediated Uptake and 
      MAP3K7-Driven Cell Death.
PG  - 117-26
LID - 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-0694 [doi]
AB  - The use of multikinase inhibitors (MKI) in oncology, such as sorafenib, is 
      associated with a cutaneous adverse event called hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR), 
      in which sites of pressure or friction become inflamed and painful, thus 
      significantly impacting quality of life. The pathogenesis of MKI-induced HFSR is 
      unknown, and the only available treatment options involve dose reduction or 
      discontinuation of therapy, which have negative effects on primary disease 
      management. To investigate the underlying mechanisms by which sorafenib promotes 
      keratinocyte cytotoxicity and subsequent HFSR induction, we performed a 
      transporter-directed RNAi screen in human epidermal keratinocytes and identified 
      SLC22A20 (OAT6) as an uptake carrier of sorafenib. Further investigations into 
      the intracellular mechanism of sorafenib activity through in situ kinome 
      profiling identified the mitogen-activated protein kinase MAP3K7 (TAK1) as a 
      target of sorafenib that induces cell death. Finally, we demonstrate that 
      sorafenib induced keratinocyte injury in vivo and that this effect could be 
      reversed by cotreatment with the OAT6 inhibitor probenecid. Collectively, our 
      findings reveal a novel pathway that regulates the entry of some MKIs into 
      keratinocytes and explains the basis underlying sorafenib-induced skin toxicity, 
      with important implications for the therapeutic management of HFSR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently available anti-leukemia drugs have shown limited success in 
      the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) due to their poor access to bone 
      marrow niche supporting leukemic cell proliferation. RESULTS: Herein, we report a 
      bone marrow-targetable green tea catechin-based micellar nanocomplex for 
      synergistic AML therapy. The nanocomplex was found to synergistically amplify the 
      anti-leukemic potency of sorafenib via selective disruption of pro-survival mTOR 
      signaling. In vivo biodistribution study demonstrated about 11-fold greater bone 
      marrow accumulation of the nanocomplex compared to free sorafenib. In AML 
      patient-derived xenograft (AML-PDX) mouse model, administration of the 
      nanocomplex effectively eradicated bone marrow-residing leukemic blasts and 
      improved survival rates without noticeable off-target toxicity. CONCLUSION: This 
      study may provide insights into the rational design of nanomedicine platforms 
      enabling bone marrow-targeted delivery of therapeutic agents for the treatment of 
      AML and other bone marrow diseases.

AB  - This dose escalation, uncontrolled phase I study evaluated the tolerability, 
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and antitumor activity of oral sorafenib 100, 200, or 400 
      mg twice daily (bid, continuous regimen) in combination with 
      5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LCV, intravenous infusion or bolus) in patients 
      with advanced, solid tumors. A total of 47 patients (median age 57 years; colon 
      cancer, 55%; pancreatic cancer, 21%; prior systemic therapy, 96%) received 
      treatment; 24 were included in the PK analyses, and 38 were evaluable for tumor 
      response. Treatment-emergent adverse events were observed in 98% of patients 
      (≥grade 3, 55%); the most frequently reported were fatigue (51%), 
      stomatitis/pharyngitis (47%), and hand-foot skin reaction (45%). Concomitant 
      5-FU/LCV resulted in no clinically relevant changes in the area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve in the dosing interval (AUC(0-12)) and maximum plasma 
      concentration (C(max)) of sorafenib (100-400 mg bid) at steady state. Although 
      the start of infusion until the last quantifiable plasma concentration 
      (AUC(0-tn)) and C(max) of 5-FU were increased by concomitant sorafenib 100 to 200 
      mg, no consistent effect was observed with 400 mg sorafenib. Two (5%) patients 
      with colon cancer achieved partial response; 16 (42%) patients (the majority with 
      colon and pancreatic cancer) had stable disease. Sorafenib plus 5-FU/LCV was 
      generally well tolerated with encouraging antitumor activity and no clinically 
      relevant drug-drug interactions in patients with advanced solid tumors.

LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S128503 [doi]
AB  - Delivery of multiple therapeutics and/or diagnostic agents to diseased tissues is 
      challenging and necessitates the development of multifunctional platforms. Among 
      the various strategies for design of multifunctional nanocarriers, biodegradable 
      polyphosphoester (PPE) polymers have been recently synthesized via a rapid and 
      simple synthetic strategy. In addition, the chemical structure of the polymer 
      could be tuned to form nanoparticles with varying surface chemistries and 
      charges, which have shown exceptional safety and biocompatibility as compared to 
      several commercial agents. The purpose of this study was to exploit a mixture of 
      PPE nanoparticles of cationic and neutral surface charges for multiple delivery 
      of anticancer drugs (ie, sorafenib and paclitaxel) and nucleic acids (ie, siRNA). 
      Cationic PPE polymers could efficiently complex siRNA, and the stability of the 
      nanoparticles could be maintained in physiological solutions and upon 
      freeze-drying and were able to deliver siRNA in vivo when injected intravenously 
      in mice. Commercially available cationic polyethylenimine polymer had LD(50) of 
      ca. 61.7 mg/kg in mice, whereas no animal died after injection of the cationic 
      PPE polymer at a dose of >130 mg/kg. Neutral PPE nanoparticles were able to 
      encapsulate two hydrophobic drugs, namely, sorafenib and paclitaxel, which are 
      commonly used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Mixing the neutral 
      and cationic PPE nanoparticles did not result in any precipitation, and the size 
      characteristics of both types of nanoparticles were maintained. Hence, PPE 
      polymers might have potential for the delivery of multiple drugs and diagnostic 
      agents to diseased tissues via simple synthesis of the individual polymers and 
      assembly into nanoparticles that can host several drugs while being mixed in the 
      same administration set, which is of importance for industrial and clinical 
      development.

TI  - Tyrosine kinase inhibitors as modulators of ATP binding cassette multidrug 
      transporters: substrates, chemosensitizers or inducers of acquired multidrug 
      resistance?
PG  - 623-42
LID - 10.1517/17425255.2011.562892 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Anticancer tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are small molecule 
      hydrophobic compounds designed to arrest aberrant signaling pathways in malignant 
      cells. Multidrug resistance (MDR) ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporters have 
      recently been recognized as important determinants of the general ADME-Tox 
      (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) properties of small 
      molecule TKIs, as well as key factors of resistance against targeted anticancer 
      therapeutics. AREAS COVERED: The article summarizes MDR-related ABC transporter 
      interactions with imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, gefitinib, erlotinib, 
      lapatinib, sunitinib and sorafenib, including in vitro and in vivo observations. 
      An array of methods developed to study such interactions is presented. 
      Transporter-TKI interactions relevant to the ADME-Tox properties of TKI drugs, 
      primary or acquired cancer TKI resistance, and drug-drug interactions are also 
      reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: Based on the concept presented in this review, TKI 
      anticancer drugs are considered as compounds recognized by the cellular 
      mechanisms handling xenobiotics. Accordingly, novel anticancer therapies should 
      equally focus on the effectiveness of target inhibition and exploration of 
      potential interactions of the designed molecules by membrane transporters. Thus, 
      targeted hydrophobic small molecule compounds should also be screened to evade 
      xenobiotic-sensing cellular mechanisms.

TI  - Phase I trial of sorafenib in combination with gefitinib in patients with 
      refractory or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.
PG  - 2684-91
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the combination of sorafenib and gefitinib in patients with 
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this dose-escalation 
      trial, patients received oral sorafenib (200-400 mg) twice daily with gefitinib 
      (250 mg orally) once daily to identify the recommended dose for phase II trials 
      (RDP; part A). The pharmacokinetics of the RDP were characterized further in 
      additional patients (part B) receiving single-agent gefitinib or sorafenib for 21 
      days followed by a 7-day washout with crossover to the other agent for an 
      additional 21 days. Patients then received the combination of sorafenib plus 
      gefitinib in 28-day cycles. Safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor efficacy were 
      evaluated. Potential drug-drug interactions and the relationship between 
      pharmacokinetics and toxicity were also assessed. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients 
      were treated (n=12, part A; n=19, part B). Most adverse events were grade 1/2. 
      The most frequent grade 3/4 events included diarrhea and elevated alanine 
      aminotransferase (both 9.7%). One dose-limiting toxicity occurred (part A: 
      elevated alanine aminotransferase at 400 mg twice daily). Gefitinib had no effect 
      on sorafenib pharmacokinetics. However, gefitinib C(max) (26%) and area under the 
      curve (38%) were reduced by concomitant sorafenib. One patient had a partial 
      response; 20 (65%; n=8, part A; n=12, part B) had stable disease >or=4 months. 
      The RDP was sorafenib 400 mg twice daily with gefitinib 250 mg once daily. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib combined with gefitinib is well tolerated, with promising 
      efficacy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Studies to further 
      investigate the significance of the reduction in gefitinib exposure by sorafenib 
      are warranted.

TI  - Exploring the role of oncolytic viruses in hepatobiliary cancers.
PG  - 971-986
LID - 10.2217/imt-2018-0048 [doi]
AB  - The standard of care for early hepatobiliary cancers (HBC) includes surgical 
      resection. Liver transplantations or locoregional therapies are beneficial in 
      early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) under certain circumstances. Systemic 
      treatments have some benefit in advanced HBC, though long-term prognosis remains 
      poor. We evaluated the role of oncolytic viruses in the treatment of HBCs through 
      a systematic literature review. The recombinant vaccinia virus JX-594 improved 
      median survival in patients with local/metastatic HCC more strongly at high dose 
      than at low dose (14.1 vs 6.7 months; p = 0.08) in a Phase II study. A Phase III 
      study with JX-594 and sorafenib in advanced HCC is ongoing. No survival benefit 
      in HCC was seen with two other recombinant adenoviruses (Ad-TK and DL1520). 
      Several preclinical trials using oncolytic viruses in HBC showed promising 
      results, warranting clinical studies.

TI  - Activity-based kinase profiling of approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

LID - 10.1111/gtc.12022 [doi]
AB  - The specificities of nine approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib, 
      dasatinib, nilotinib, gefitinib, erlotinib, lapatinib, sorafenib, sunitinib, and 
      pazopanib) were determined by activity-based kinase profiling using a large panel 
      of human recombinant active kinases. This panel consisted of 79 tyrosine kinases, 
      199 serine/threonine kinases, three lipid kinases, and 29 disease-relevant mutant 
      kinases. Many potential targets of each inhibitor were identified by kinase 
      profiling at the K(m) for ATP. In addition, profiling at a physiological ATP 
      concentration (1 mm) was carried out, and the IC(50) values of the inhibitors 
      against each kinase were compared with the estimated plasma-free concentration 
      (calculated from published pharmacokinetic parameters of plasma C(trough) and 
      C(max) values). This analysis revealed that the approved kinase inhibitors were 
      well optimized for their target kinases. This profiling also implicates activity 
      at particular off-target kinases in drug side effects. Thus, large-scale kinase 
      profiling at both K(m) and physiological ATP concentrations could be useful in 
      characterizing the targets and off-targets of kinase inhibitors.

AB  - A series of novel hybrid pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyramidine derivatives was designed and 
      chemically synthesized in useful yields. The synthesized compounds were 
      structurally characterized by the usual techniques. All the new synthesized 
      compounds were biologically screened in vitro for their antiproliferative 
      activities against a panel of four cancer cell lines, namely HepG-2, MCF-7, 
      HCT-116, and Hela. The results of cytotoxic evaluation indicated that compound 
      14d was appeared to be the most prominent broad-spectrum cytotoxic activity and 
      significantly more potent than sorafenib with IC(50) values of 4.28, 5.18, 3.97, 
      and 9.85 µM against four cell lines (HePG2, Hela, HCT-116 and MCF-7). In 
      addition, compound 15 was displayed promising antiproliferative effect against 
      all tested cell lines with IC(50) value less than 11 µM compared with sorafenib 
      as a control drug. Besides, structurally pharmacophoric features indicated that 
      pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine scaffold having an amide linker and substituted with 
      phenyl moiety at the 5-position was more potent than those possessing azomethine 
      methyl, azomethine proton and carbomethene linkers, which lead to significant 
      decrease in antiproliferative activity. The most potent compounds were further 
      selected and evaluated for their activities against epidermal growth factor 
      receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors according to homogenous time resolved 
      fluorescence (HTRF) assay. The most potent compound 14d exhibited the most 
      promising inhibitory activity against EGFR(WT) with IC(50) value of 
      56.02 ± 1.38 µM compared with gefitinib as control drug with IC(50) value of 
      41.79 ± 1.07 µM. Moreover, the inhibition of cell cycle progression and induction 
      of apoptosis in the A549 cell line at G2/M and pre-G1 phases of cell cycle might 
      contribute to cancer treatment that evaluated by Annexin V-FITC/PI double 
      staining detection method. Finally, molecular docking studies were conducted to 
      investigate that probable binding conformations of these anticancer agents and 
      ADME properties were calculated to predict pharmacokinetics and toxic properties 
      of the target compounds.

      glioma.

LID - 10.1093/neuonc/nor145 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib is an inhibitor of multiple kinases that has demonstrated 
      antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activity in a number of in vitro and in vivo 
      model systems. A phase I study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated 
      dose (MTD) of sorafenib in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. Sorafenib 
      was given orally, twice a day (BID), continuously in 28-day cycles. The dose was 
      escalated in 2 groups of patients stratified by use of enzyme-inducing 
      antiseizure drugs (± EIASDs). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any 
      grades 3-4 nonhematological toxicity, grade 4 hematological toxicity, and febrile 
      neutropenia. The number of evaluable patients enrolled in the +EIASD and -EIASD 
      arms were 23 and 24, respectively. DLTs were predominantly dermatological and 
      gastrointestinal effects, as observed in previous clinical trials of sorafenib. 
      The MTD was 600 mg BID for patients receiving EIASDs and 800 mg BID for those who 
      were not. The plasma pharmacokinetics of sorafenib were not significantly 
      affected by the concurrent administration of EIASDs. The MTD of sorafenib given 
      orally BID on a continuous basis was established as 600 mg BID in patients with 
      malignant glioma who were concurrently receiving EIASDs and 800 mg BID in those 
      who were not. Further evaluation is warranted of sorafenib at the recommended MTD 
      against recurrent or progressive malignant glioma in combination with other 
      molecularly targeted drugs or in the newly diagnosed setting concurrent with 
      chemoradiation.

TI  - A phase I and pharmacokinetic study of ganetespib (STA-9090) in advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 128-37
LID - 10.1007/s10637-014-0164-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ganetespib (STA-9090) is an Hsp90 inhibitor that downregulates VEGFR, 
      c-MET, HER2, IGF-IR, EGFR, and other Hsp90 client proteins involved in 
      hepatocarcinogenesis, thereby making it an attractive therapy for HCC. This Phase 
      I study was performed to establish the safety, tolerability, recommended Phase 2 
      dose (RP2D), and preliminary clinical activity of ganetespib in previously 
      treated patients with advanced HCC. METHODS: Patients with advanced HCC, 
      Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, progression on or intolerance to sorafenib, and ECOG 
      PS ≤ 1 were enrolled in a standard 3x3 dose escalation study at doses of 100 
      mg/m(2), 150 mg/m(2), and 200 mg/m(2) IV given on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 
      28-day cycle. Objective response by RECIST version 1.1 criteria was evaluated by 
      CT/MRI every 8 weeks. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were enrolled in this trial and 
      received at least one dose of the study drug. Of the 14 patients: median age, 57 
      years old; male 71 %; Asian 36 %; HCC etiology (HBV 36 %, HCV 43 %, 
      Hemachromatosis 7 %, unknown 21 %); Child Pugh Class (A 93 %, B 7 %); median 
      number of prior treatments 2; median baseline AFP 70.1 ng/mL. The RP2D was 
      determined to be 200 mg/m(2). The most commonly seen AEs were diarrhea (93 %), 
      fatigue (71 %), AST elevation (64 %), and hyperglycemia (64 %). The most common 
      Gr 3/4 AEs were hyperglycemia (21 %) and lipasemia (21 %). One (7 %) patient had 
      a fatal AE, septic shock, within 30 days of receiving the study drug. One 
      dose-limiting toxicity, grade 3 lipasemia, was observed at the 100 mg/m(2) dose. 
      Pharmacokinetics studies showed a t1/2, CL, Tmax, and Vss of 6.45 h, 48.28 L/h 
      (25.56 L/h/m(2)), 0.76 h, and 191 L (100.4 L/m(2)), respectively. No objective 
      responses were seen; one patient (7 %) had stable disease at 16 weeks. Median 
      time to progression was 1.8 months, and median overall survival was 7.2 months. 
      CONCLUSION: Ganetespib had a manageable safety profile in patients with advanced 
      HCC who had progressed on at least one line of systemic therapy. The 
      pharmacokinetic profile showed that ganetespib exposure in patients with mild 
      hepatic dysfunction is similar to that seen in patients with normal liver 
      function. Ganetespib showed limited clinical benefit in patients with advanced 
      HCC in this phase I trial.

TI  - Crenolanib is active against models of drug-resistant FLT3-ITD-positive acute 
      myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 3607-15
LID - 10.1182/blood-2013-07-513044 [doi]
AB  - FLT3 kinase internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations are common in acute 
      myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with poor clinical outcomes. Although 
      initial responses to FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are observed in 
      FLT3-ITD-positive patients, subsequent relapse often occurs upon acquisition of 
      secondary FLT3 kinase domain (KD) mutations, primarily at residues D835 and F691. 
      Using biochemical assays, we determined that crenolanib, a novel TKI, 
      demonstrates type I properties and is active against FLT3 containing ITD and/or 
      D835- or F691-activating mutations. Potent activity was observed in 
      FLT3-ITD-positive AML cell lines. Crenolanib delayed the outgrowth of MV4-11 
      cells in a xenograft mouse model, whereas in combination with the type II TKI 
      sorafenib, a significant decrease in leukemic burden (P < .001) and prolonged 
      survival (P < .01) was observed compared with either type I or II TKI alone. 
      Crenolanib was active against Ba/F3 cells harboring FLT3-ITD and secondary KD 
      mutations and sorafenib-resistant MOLM-13 cells containing FLT3-ITD/D835Y both in 
      vitro and in vivo. In addition, crenolanib inhibited drug-resistant AML primary 
      blasts with FLT3-ITD and D835H/Y mutations. These preclinical data demonstrate 
      that crenolanib is effective against FLT3-ITD containing secondary KD mutations, 
      suggesting that crenolanib may be a useful therapeutic agent for TKI-naive and 
      drug-resistant FLT3-ITD-positive AML.

TI  - Discovery of new 3-methylquinoxalines as potential anti-cancer agents and 
      apoptosis inducers targeting VEGFR-2: design, synthesis, and in silico studies.
PG  - 1732-1750
LID - 10.1080/14756366.2021.1945591 [doi]
AB  - There is an urgent need to design new anticancer agents that can prevent cancer 
      cell proliferation even with minimal side effects. Accordingly, two new series of 
      3-methylquinoxalin-2(1H)-one and 3-methylquinoxaline-2-thiol derivatives were 
      designed to act as VEGFR-2 inhibitors. The designed derivatives were synthesised 
      and evaluated in vitro as cytotoxic agents against two human cancer cell lines 
      namely, HepG-2 and MCF-7. Also, the synthesised derivatives were assessed for 
      their VEGFR-2inhibitory effect. The most promising member 11e were further 
      investigated to reach a valuable insight about its apoptotic effect through cell 
      cycle and apoptosis analyses. Moreover, deep investigations were carried out for 
      compound 11e using western-plot analyses to detect its effect against some 
      apoptotic and apoptotic parameters including caspase-9, caspase-3, BAX, and 
      Bcl-2. Many in silico investigations including docking, ADMET, toxicity studies 
      were performed to predict binding affinity, pharmacokinetic, drug likeness, and 
      toxicity of the synthesised compounds. The results revealed that compounds 11e, 
      11g, 12e, 12g, and 12k exhibited promising cytotoxic activities (IC(50) range is 
      2.1 - 9.8 µM), comparing to sorafenib (IC(50) = 3.4 and 2.2 µM against MCF-7 and 
      HepG2, respectively). Moreover, 11b, 11f, 11g, 12e, 12f, 12g, and 12k showed the 
      highest VEGFR-2 inhibitory activities (IC(50) range is 2.9 - 5.4 µM), comparing 
      to sorafenib (IC(50) = 3.07 nM). Additionally, compound 11e had good potential to 
      arrest the HepG2 cell growth at G2/M phase and to induce apoptosis by 49.14% 
      compared to the control cells (9.71%). As well, such compound showed a 
      significant increase in the level of caspase-3 (2.34-fold), caspase-9 
      (2.34-fold), and BAX (3.14-fold), and a significant decrease in Bcl-2 level 
      (3.13-fold). For in silico studies, the synthesised compounds showed binding mode 
      similar to that of the reference compound (sorafenib).

AB  - Allyl glycidyl ether/N-isopropylacrylamide-grafted magnetic nanoparticles were 
      prepared using silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles as a substrate for radical 
      copolymerization of allyl glycidyl ether and N-isopropylacrylamide. Chitosan was 
      coupled with the prepared nanoparticles by opening the epoxy ring of the allyl 
      glycidyl ether. The thermosensitive magnetic nanocarrier (TSMNC) obtained can be 
      applied as a potent drug carrier. The TSMNC structure was characterized using 
      Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric 
      analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, vibrating sample magnetometer, and 
      elemental analysis. Its morphology and size were investigated using field 
      emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and 
      dynamic light scattering. The feasibility of employing the TSMNC for adsorption 
      and in vitro controlled release of the chemotherapeutic agent sorafenib was 
      tested. The effect of the adsorption parameters of pH, temperature, and loading 
      time of sorafenib onto TSMNC was evaluated. The adsorption data was fitted to the 
      Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms and the relevant parameters derived. The drug 
      release profile indicated that 88% of the adsorbed drug was released within 35h 
      at 45°C and drug release was Fickian diffusion-controlled. The results confirmed 
      that the TSMNC has a high adsorption capacity at low temperature and good 
      controlled release in a slow rate at a high temperature and could be developed 
      for further application as a drug nanocarrier.

AB  - PURPOSE: To characterize the cardiovascular profile of sorafenib, a multitargeted 
      kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: Fifty-three patients 
      with advanced cancer received oral sorafenib 400 mg bid in continuous 28-day 
      cycles in this open-label study. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 
      evaluated using multigated acquisition scanning at baseline and after 2 and 4 
      cycles of sorafenib. QT/QTc interval on the electrocardiograph (ECG) was measured 
      in triplicate with a Holter 12-lead ECG at baseline and after 1 cycle of 
      sorafenib. Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were obtained in duplicate at 
      baseline and after 1 and 4 cycles of sorafenib. Plasma pharmacokinetic data were 
      obtained for sorafenib and its 3 main metabolites after 1 and 4 cycles of 
      sorafenib. RESULTS: LVEF (SD) mean change from baseline was -0.8 (±8.6) LVEF(%) 
      after 2 cycles (n = 31) and -1.2 (±7.8) LVEF(%) after 4 cycles of sorafenib (n = 
      24). The QT/QTc mean changes from baseline observed at maximum sorafenib 
      concentrations (t(max)) after 1 cycle (n = 31) were small (QTcB: 4.2 ms; QTcF: 
      9.0 ms). Mean changes observed after 1 cycle in BP (n = 31) and HR (n = 30) at 
      maximum sorafenib concentrations (t(max)) were moderate (up to 11.7 mm Hg and 
      -6.6 bpm, respectively). No correlation was found between the AUC and C(max) of 
      sorafenib and its main metabolites and any cardiovascular parameters. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The effects of sorafenib on changes in QT/QTc interval on the ECG, 
      LVEF, BP, and HR were modest and unlikely to be of clinical significance in the 
      setting of advanced cancer treatment.

AB  - Pursuing on our efforts regarding development of novel multikinase inhibitors, 
      herein we report the design and synthesis of novel 2-indolinone-based ureides 
      6a-u and amides 10a-j. In this work we adopt a hybridization strategy between 
      type IIA PTK inhibitor (sorafenib) and type IIB PTK inhibitors (sunitinib and 
      nintedanib). This was implemented via linking the indolinone core, in both 
      sunitinib and nintedanib, which is well-fitted in the hinge region in the kinase 
      domain front cleft and the biaryl urea extension, in sorafenib, which is 
      accommodated in the gate area and the hydrophobic back pocket. Molecular docking 
      of the designed hybrid compounds in VEGFR-2 and FGFR-1 active sites revealed, as 
      planned, their ability to establish the binding interactions achieved by both 
      original type IIA and type IIB inhibitors. The designed compounds were evaluated 
      for their multikinase inhibitory activity towards VEGFR-2, PDGFR-b and FGFR-1 and 
      anti-proliferative activity towards HepG2, MCF-7, A549 and A498 cancer cell 
      lines. The ureido analogue 6u emerged as the most potent multikinase inhibitor in 
      the ureido series with VEGFR-2, FGFR-1 and PDGFR-b IC(50) of 0.18, 0.23 and 
      0.10 μM, respectively. Whereas, the amido congener 10j emerged as the most potent 
      multikinase inhibitor in the amide series with VEGFR-2, FGFR-1 and PDGFR-b IC(50) 
      of 0.28, 0.46 and 0.09 μM, respectively. While, indolinone 6u was the most potent 
      derivative towards HepG2 cells (IC(50) = 2.67 ± 0.14 μM), 6r stood out as the 
      most potent indolinone against A498 cells (IC(50) = 0.78 ± 0.02 μM). 
      Additionally, the target indolinones displayed non-significant cytotoxic impact 
      towards human normal melanocyte (HFB4). ADME prediction study of the designed 
      compounds showed that they are not only with promising multikinase inhibitory 
      activity but also with favorable pharmacokinetic and drug-likeness properties. 
      Compounds 6r and 10j are revealed to be the best compounds in terms of 
      multikinase activity and pharmacokinetics.

AB  - The magnitude of interindividual pharmacokinetic variability (IIV) of a drug and 
      the factors responsible for this variability are intensively studied before-and 
      sometimes after-registration as crucial information in anticipating and 
      understanding variability in toxicity and efficacy. However, there has been much 
      less attention paid to intraindividual variability, reflecting random or 
      systematic changes in an individual's pharmacokinetics over time. We have chosen 
      to focus on small-molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs).

AB  - Nanotechniques show significant merits in terms of improving the oral 
      bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs. However, the mechanisms behind are 
      not clear yet. For instance, what is the contribution of free drug released 
      during nanogranule transcytosis, as well as the impact of drug transporter and 
      chylomicron? To address these issues, sorafenib nanogranules (SFN-NGs) were 
      prepared as model by the high-gravity antisolvent precipitation method which 
      approaches to practical mass production. Then, a multiaspect study on the 
      transcytosis mechanism of SFN-NGs was conducted in Caco-2 cells and rats, 
      including paracellular transport, endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, 
      transmembrane pathway, as well as the involvement of transporter and chylomicron. 
      Pharmacokinetics in rats demonstrated an obvious superiority of SFN-NGs in oral 
      absorption and lymphatic transfer over SFN crude drugs. Different from free SFN, 
      SFN-NGs could be internalized in cells in early stage by caveolin/lipid raft or 
      clathrin induced endocytosis, and transported intactly through the polarized cell 
      monolayers. While in late stage, transporter-mediated transport of free SFN began 
      to play a vital role on the transmembrane of SFN-NGs. No paracellular transport 
      of SFN-NGs was found, and the trafficking of SFN-NGs was affected by the pathway 
      of ER-Golgi complexes. Surprisedly, the intracellular free SFN was the main 
      source of transmembrane for SFN-NGs, which was entrapped into chylomicrons and 
      then secreted into the extracellular space. Generally, the findings in current 
      study may shed light on the absorption mechanism of oral nanoformulations.

TI  - Ultrasound-Triggered Nanodroplets for Targeted Co-Delivery of 
      Sorafenib/Doxorubicin for Hepatocellular Carcinoma Therapy.
PG  - 1881-1896
LID - 10.1166/jbn.2019.2823 [doi]
AB  - The clinical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma has been hindered due to the 
      drug resistance and heterogeneity of tumor cells. A new therapy strategy combined 
      chemo drugs and molecular-targeted drugs is considered to be promising for 
      conquering these challenges. However, the different pharmacokinetic profiles, 
      hydrophobicity and systemic toxicity of these drugs may still cause serious 
      challenges to the clinical applications of this combination therapy. In this 
      study, smart sorafenib (SF) and doxorubicin (DOX)-loaded nanodroplets 
      (SF/DOX-NDs) were fabricated to solve the above issues. The liquid-to-gas phase 
      transition of SF/DOX-NDs could function as a cavitation nucleus to boost drug 
      release and increase cellular uptake after exposure to therapeutic ultrasound 
      (TUS) irradiation. Additionally, this strategy has a therapeutic effect to induce 
      apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of hepatoma 
      cells. Furthermore, the intense cavitation of SF/DOX-NDs at the tumor site could 
      disrupt microvessels, which is beneficial for tissue-penetrating drug delivery 
      inside tumors. Consequently, tumor angiogenesis was reduced, and tumor growth was 
      remarkably inhibited by SF/DOX-NDs. These results indicated that combination 
      therapy using SF/DOX-NDs may offer a promising approach to achieve effective HCC 
      therapy with low side effects.

TI  - Randomized, open-label phase 2 study comparing frontline dovitinib versus 
      sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 774-84
LID - 10.1002/hep.28600 [doi]
AB  - Angiogenesis inhibition by the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 
      (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) inhibitor sorafenib 
      provides survival benefit in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, angiogenic 
      escape from sorafenib may occur due to angiogenesis-associated fibroblast growth 
      factor receptor (FGFR) pathway activation. In addition to VEGFR and PDGFR, 
      dovitinib inhibits FGFR. Frontline oral dovitinib (500 mg/day, 5 days on, 2 days 
      off; n = 82) versus sorafenib (400 mg twice daily; n = 83) was evaluated in an 
      open-label, randomized phase 2 study of Asian-Pacific patients with advanced HCC. 
      The primary and key secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and time to 
      tumor progression (TTP) as determined by a local investigator, respectively. 
      Patients included in the study were ineligible for surgical and/or locoregional 
      therapies or had disease progression after receiving these therapies. The median 
      OS (95% confidence interval [CI]) was 8.0 (6.6-9.1) months for dovitinib and 8.4 
      (5.4-11.3) months for sorafenib. The median TTP (95% CI) per investigator 
      assessment was 4.1 (2.8-4.2) months and 4.1 (2.8-4.3) months for dovitinib and 
      sorafenib, respectively. Common any-cause adverse events included diarrhea (62%), 
      decreased appetite (43%), nausea (41%), vomiting (41%), fatigue (35%), rash 
      (34%), and pyrexia (30%) for dovitinib and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia 
      syndrome (66%) and decreased appetite (31%) for sorafenib. Subgroup analysis 
      revealed a significantly higher median OS for patients in the dovitinib arm who 
      had baseline plasma soluble VEGFR1 (sVEGFR1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) 
      below median levels versus at or above the median levels (median OS [95% CI]: 
      sVEGFR1, 11.2 [9.0-13.8] and 5.7 [4.3-7.0] months, respectively [P = .0002]; HGF, 
      11.2 [8.9-13.8] and 5.9 [5.0-7.6] months, respectively [P = 0.0002]). CONCLUSION: 
      Dovitinib was well tolerated, but activity was not greater than sorafenib as a 
      frontline systemic therapy for HCC. Based on these data, no subsequent phase 3 
      study has been planned. (Hepatology 2016;64:774-784).

LID - 10.1200/JCO.2012.43.5362 [doi]
AB  - Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) provides valuable guidance for dose adjustment 
      of antibiotics, immunosuppressives, antiepileptics, and other drugs, but its use 
      for traditional anticancer therapies has been limited. Perhaps the most important 
      obstacle is the impractical requirement of multiple blood samples to adequately 
      define systemic exposure of drugs that have a short elimination half-life and are 
      given by intermittent intravenous injections. However, the newer targeted 
      anticancer therapies have different pharmacokinetic (PK) and dosing 
      characteristics compared with traditional cytotoxic drugs, making it possible to 
      estimate the steady-state drug exposure with a single trough-level measurement. 
      Recent evidence indicates that certain PK parameters, including trough levels, 
      are correlated with clinical outcomes for many of these agents, including 
      imatinib, sunitinib, rituximab, and cetuximab. Although the current evidence is 
      insufficient to mandate TDM in routine practice, a concerted investigation should 
      be encouraged to determine whether the steady-state trough measurements of 
      targeted agents will have a practical place in the clinical care of patients with 
      cancer.

AB  - Anti-angiogenic treatment is an important option that has changed the therapeutic 
      landscape in various tumors, particularly in patients affected by renal cell 
      carcinoma (RCC). Agents that block signaling pathways governing tumor 
      angiogenesis have raised high expectations among clinicians. Vascular endothelial 
      growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (VEGFR-TKIs) comprise a 
      heterogeneous class of drugs with distinct pharmacological profiles, including 
      potency, selectivity, pharmacokinetics and drug-drug interactions. Among them, 
      tivozanib is one of the last TKIs introduced in the clinical practice; this drug 
      selectively targets VEGFRs, it is characterized by a favorable pharmacokinetics 
      and safety profile and has been approved as first-line treatment for patients 
      with metastatic RCC (mRCC). In this article, we describe the clinical 
      pharmacology of selected VEGFR-TKIs used for the treatment of mRCC, highlighting 
      the relevant differences; moreover we aim to define the main pharmacologic 
      characteristics of these drug.

TI  - Novel analogs of sulfasalazine as system x(c)(-) antiporter inhibitors: Insights 
      from the molecular modeling studies.
PG  - 758-777
LID - 10.1002/ddr.21557 [doi]
AB  - System x(c)(-) (Sx(c)(-) ), a cystine-glutamate antiporter, is established as an 
      interesting target for the treatment of several pathologies including epileptic 
      seizures, glioma, neurodegenerative diseases, and multiple sclerosis. Erastin, 
      sorafenib, and sulfasalazine (SSZ) are a few of the established inhibitors of 
      Sx(c)(-) . However, its pharmacological inhibition with novel and potent agents 
      is still very much required due to potential issues, for example, potency, 
      bioavailability, and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, with the current 
      lead molecules such as SSZ. Therefore, in this study, we report the synthesis and 
      structure-activity relationships (SAR) of SSZ derivatives along with molecular 
      docking and dynamics simulations using the developed homology model of xCT chain 
      of Sx(c)(-) antiporter. The generated homology model attempted to address the 
      limitations of previously reported comparative protein models, thereby increasing 
      the confidence in the computational modeling studies. The main objective of the 
      present study was to derive a suitable lead structure from SSZ eliminating its 
      potential issues for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), a deadly and 
      malignant grade IV astrocytoma. The designed compounds with favorable Sx(c)(-) 
      inhibitory activity following in vitro Sx(c)(-) inhibition studies, showed 
      moderately potent cytotoxicity in patient-derived human glioblastoma cells, 
      thereby generating potential interest in these compounds. The xCT-ligand model 
      can be further optimized in search of potent lead molecules for novel drug 
      discovery and development studies.

      activity.
PG  - 39-50
LID - 10.2217/fon.14.208 [doi]
AB  - Dovitinib is an oral multikinase inhibitor targeting FGF receptors, PDGF 
      receptors and VEGF receptors. Its activity against FGF receptors suggests its 
      usefulness in treating cancers after the failure of VEGF/VEGF receptor-targeting 
      agents. The identified dose and schedule to be used in further studies was 500 mg 
      orally for 5 days on and 2 days off. Biological considerations and the results 
      achieved in a Phase I/II trial suggested its activity in advanced renal cell 
      carcinoma patients pretreated with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor and an mTOR 
      inhibitor. Surprisingly, in a randomized controlled Phase III trial versus 
      sorafenib in the same setting, dovitinib failed to demonstrate any superiority. 
      At present, dovitinib is being tested in different tumor types. However, 
      molecular-based patient selection seems to be key to fully exploit the activity 
      of this drug.

LID - 10.2147/IJN.S237335 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In spite of its enhanced efficacy and reduced side effects in clinical 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy, the therapeutic efficacy of antitumor 
      angiogenesis inhibitor sorafenib (SFB) is still restricted due to short in vivo 
      half-life and drug resistance. Here, a novel SFB-loaded dendritic polymeric 
      nanoparticle (NP-TPGS-SFB) was developed for enhanced therapy of HCC. METHODS: 
      NP-TPGS-SFB was fabricated by encapsulating SFB with biodegradable dendritic 
      polymers poly(amidoamine)-poly(γ-benzyl-L-Glutamate)-b-D-α-tocopheryl 
      polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (PAM-PBLG-b-TPGS). RESULTS: NP-TPGS-SFB 
      exhibited excellent stability and achieved acid-responsive release of SFB. It 
      also exhibited much higher cellular uptake efficiency in HepG2 human liver cells 
      than PEG-conjugated NP (NP-PEG-SFB). Furthermore, MTT assay confirmed that 
      NP-TPGS-SFB induced higher cytotoxicity than NP-PEG-SFB and free SFB, 
      respectively. Lastly, NP-TPGS-SFB significantly inhibited tumor growth in mice 
      bearing HepG2 xenografts, with negligible side effects. CONCLUSION: Our result 
      suggests that NP-TPGS-SFB may be a novel approach for enhanced therapy of HCC 
      with promising potential.

TI  - Fractionation of daily dose increases the predicted risk of severe 
      sorafenib-induced hand-foot syndrome (HFS).
PG  - 287-97

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective was to quantify the risk dynamics for the 
      sorafenib-induced hand-foot syndrome (HFS) and to explore by simulations the 
      dose-toxicity relationships according to different dosing regimens. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: Eighty-nine patients treated with sorafenib were considered: Treatment 
      duration and regimen, and number and frequency of HFS observations were highly 
      variable. A nonlinear mixed-effect model was built to link sorafenib 
      administrations to the risk of each HFS score, through a latent variable model. 
      Model evaluation was driven by goodness-of-fit and simulation-based diagnostics. 
      Impact of sorafenib regimen on HFS dynamics was evaluated by simulations. A 
      surrogate measure of benefit-to-risk ratio was calculated by using the concept of 
      utility function, accounting for efficacy on tumor growth inhibition and severe 
      HFS risk. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: An original pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic 
      model for sorafenib-induced HFS, including the kinetics of a latent variable 
      model, relating sorafenib administrations, per se its exposure, to HFS dynamics 
      is proposed. From the model simulations, it appears that the more the daily dose 
      is fractioned, the more the patients are at risk of HFS. Interestingly, the 
      number of daily occasions was found more influential than the dose itself. Taking 
      into account tumor growth inhibition in the utility function, the twice-daily 
      administration schedule is favored for daily doses >600 mg. This approach 
      illustrates how understanding the dynamic relationship between drug 
      administrations and a limiting adverse event may help to control toxicity and 
      adequately adjust treatment modalities.

AB  - Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) can be defined as the measurement of drug in 
      biological samples to individualise treatment by adapting drug dose to improve 
      efficacy and/or reduce toxicity. The cytotoxic drugs are characterised by steep 
      dose-response relationships and narrow therapeutic windows. Inter-individual 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) variability is often substantial. There are, however, a 
      multitude of reasons why TDM has never been fully implemented in daily oncology 
      practice. These include difficulties in establishing appropriate concentration 
      target, common use of combination chemotherapies and the paucity of published 
      data from pharmacological trials. The situation is different with targeted 
      therapies. The large interindividual PK variability is influenced by the 
      pharmacogenetic background of the patient (e.g. cytochrome P450 and ABC 
      transporters polymorphisms), patient characteristics such as adherence to 
      treatment and environmental factors (drug-drug interactions). Retrospective 
      studies have shown that targeted drug exposure correlates with treatment response 
      in various cancers. Evidence for imatinib currently exists, others are emerging 
      for compounds including nilotinib, dasatinib, erlotinib, sunitinib, sorafenib and 
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. Applications for TDM during oral 
      targeted therapies may best be reserved for particular situations including lack 
      of therapeutic response, severe or unexpected toxicities, anticipated drug-drug 
      interactions and concerns over adherence treatment. There are still few data with 
      monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in favour of TDM approaches, even if data showed 
      encouraging results with rituximab and cetuximab. TDM of mAbs is not yet 
      supported by scientific evidence. Considerable effort should be made for targeted 
      therapies to better define concentration-effect relationships and to perform 
      comparative randomised trials of classic dosing versus pharmacokinetically-guided 
      adaptive dosing.

TI  - Results of a Phase I trial of sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) in combination with 
      doxorubicin in patients with refractory solid tumors.
PG  - 866-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006), a novel, oral multi-kinase inhibitor, blocks 
      serine/threonine and receptor tyrosine kinases in the tumor and vasculature. 
      Sorafenib demonstrated single-agent activity in Phase I studies, and was 
      tolerated and inhibited tumor growth in combination with doxorubicin in 
      preclinical studies. This Phase I dose-escalation study determined the safety, 
      pharmacokinetics and efficacy of sorafenib plus doxorubicin. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: Thirty-four patients with refractory, solid tumors received doxorubicin 
      60 mg/m(2) on Day 1 of 3-week cycles, and oral sorafenib from Day 4 of Cycle 1 at 
      100, 200 or 400 mg bid. RESULTS: Common drug-related adverse events were 
      neutropenia (56%), hand-foot skin reaction (44%), stomatitis (32%), and diarrhea 
      (32%). The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. One patient with pleural 
      mesothelioma achieved a partial response (modified WHO criteria) and remained on 
      therapy for 39.7 weeks. Fifteen patients (48%) achieved stable disease for >/=12 
      weeks. Doxorubicin exposure increased moderately with sorafenib 400 mg bid. The 
      pharmacokinetics of sorafenib and doxorubicinol were not affected. CONCLUSION: 
      Sorafenib 400 mg bid plus doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) was well tolerated. The 
      increased doxorubicin exposure with sorafenib 400 mg bid did not result in 
      significantly increased toxicity; low patient numbers make the clinical 
      significance of this unclear. These promising efficacy results justify further 
      clinical investigation.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic results of a phase I trial of sorafenib in combination with 
      dacarbazine in patients with advanced solid tumors.
PG  - 53-61
LID - 10.1007/s00280-010-1423-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor of Raf and several growth factor 
      receptors, is under investigation in combination with dacarbazine, a commonly 
      used chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of many cancers. The current phase 
      I study investigates the effects of sorafenib on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile 
      of dacarbazine and its metabolite 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC). (AIC is 
      formed in amounts equimolar to the active alkylating moiety, methane 
      diazohydroxide, which is undetectable by known validated assays.) METHODS: 
      Patients with advanced solid tumors received intravenous dacarbazine 
      1,000 mg/m(2) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle to evaluate the PK of dacarbazine alone. 
      Sorafenib 400 mg was administered twice daily continuously starting at day 2 of 
      cycle 1. The PK of dacarbazine in the presence of sorafenib was assessed on day 1 
      of cycle 2. Sorafenib PK was also assessed at steady state. RESULTS: PK data were 
      available for 15 of 23 patients. With concomitant administration of sorafenib, 
      the mean AUC and C (max) values of dacarbazine were reduced by 23 and 16%, 
      respectively. Mean AUC and C (max) values of AIC were increased by 41 and 45%, 
      respectively, with individual increases of up to 106 and 136%, respectively. The 
      apparent terminal half-lives of the two compounds were not significantly 
      influenced by sorafenib. Based on coefficients of variation, the AUC and C (max) 
      values for sorafenib and its three metabolites were highly variable with 
      dacarbazine coadministration. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant administration of 
      sorafenib and dacarbazine as described above may result in decreased dacarbazine 
      exposure but increased AIC exposure.

AB  - Nanoparticulate system with theranostic applications has attracted significant 
      attention in cancer therapeutics. In the present study, we have developed a novel 
      composite PLGA NP co-encapsulated with anticancer drug (sorafenib) and magnetic 
      NP (SPION). We have successfully developed nanosized folate-conjugated PEGylated 
      PLGA nanoparticles (SRF/FA-PEG-PLGA NP) with both anticancer and magnetic 
      resonance property. We have showed that FA-conjugated NP exhibits sustained drug 
      release and enhanced cellular uptake in BEL7402 cancer cells. The targeted NP 
      effectively suppressed the tumor cell proliferation and has improved the 
      anticancer efficacy than that of free drug or non-targeted one. Additionally, 
      enhanced MRI properties demonstrate this formulation has good imaging agent 
      characteristics. Finally, SRF/FA-PEG-PLGA NP effectively inhibited the colony 
      forming ability indicating its superior anticancer effect. Together, these 
      multifunctional nanoparticles would be most ideal to improve the therapeutic 
      response in cancer and holds great potential to be a part of future nanomedicine. 
      Our unique approach could be extended for multiple biomedical applications.

TI  - Sorafenib Decreases Tumor Exposure to an Anti-carcinoembryonic Antigen Monoclonal 
      Antibody in a Mouse Model of Colorectal Cancer.
PG  - 923-32

AB  - In this investigation, we test the hypothesis that treatment with sorafenib, an 
      anti-angiogenic agent, decreases tumor vascularization and, consequently, hinders 
      the delivery of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to xenograft tumors. Severe combined 
      immunodeficiency mice bearing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) expressing tumor 
      xenografts were divided into control and sorafenib-treated groups. Sorafenib was 
      administered to the latter group at 50 mg/kg IP every 48 h, starting 4 days 
      post-tumor implantation. When tumors attained a size of 200-300 mm(3), mice were 
      evaluated for (a) tumor microvessel density (using immunohistochemical analysis), 
      (b) tumor macromolecular extravasation (using Evans Blue Dye (EBD)), (c) 
      pharmacokinetics of an anti-CEA mAb, T84.66, following an intravenous dose of 
      10 mg/kg, and (d) intra-tumoral spatial distribution of T84.66 (using 
      autoradiography). Sorafenib treatment resulted in a substantial reduction in 
      tumor growth rate, a visible reduction in tumor microvessel density, and in a 
      46.4% decrease in EBD extravasation in tumor tissue (p < 0.0455). For control and 
      treated mice, no significant difference was found for the area under the mAb 
      plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-7d): 1.67 × 10(3) ± 1.28 × 10(2) vs. 
      1.76 × 10(3) ± 1.75 × 10(2) nM × day, p = 0.51). However, tumor AUC(0-7d) was 
      reduced by 40.8% in sorafenib-treated mice relative to that observed in control 
      mice (5.61 × 10(2) ± 4.27 × 10(1) vs. 9.48 × 10(2) ± 5.61 × 10(1) nM × day, 
      p < 0.001). Sorafenib therapy was also found to markedly alter mAb tumor spatial 
      distribution. The results collectively suggest that sorafenib treatment causes a 
      significant reduction in mAb delivery to, and distribution within, solid tumors.

TI  - Selective targeting of tumor cells and tumor associated macrophages separately by 
      twin-like core-shell nanoparticles for enhanced tumor-localized 
      chemoimmunotherapy.
PG  - 13934-13946
LID - 10.1039/c9nr03374b [doi]
AB  - Tumor associated macrophage (TAM)-based immunotherapy has been presented as a 
      promising strategy in cancer therapy. The combination of TAM-based immunotherapy 
      with sorafenib (SF) could be conceivably quite more effective in hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) treatment. A co-delivery system was superior in improving the 
      co-accumulation of two drugs in tumor tissues for chemoimmunotherapy, while in 
      the case of selective targeting of separated cells such as tumor cells and immune 
      cells, a novel targeted co-delivery strategy was badly required. In this study, 
      twin-like core-shell nanoparticles (TCN) were developed for synchronous 
      biodistribution and separated cell targeting delivery of SF and TAM 
      re-polarization agents IMD-0354 to cancer cells and TAM to enhance 
      tumor-localized chemoimmunotherapy, respectively. First of all, SF loaded 
      cationic lipid-based nanoparticles (SF-CLN) and mannose-modified IMD-0354 loaded 
      cationic lipid-based nanoparticles (M-IMD-CLN) were prepared, respectively. SF on 
      the surface of SF-CLN and mannose on the M-IMD-CLN were regarded as targeting 
      ligands for selective targeting delivery of SF-CLN and M-IMD-CLN to cancer cells 
      and TAM separately. Then, pH-responsive charge reversal polymer 
      O-carboxymethyl-chitosan (CMCS) was coated on the SF-CLN and M-IMD-CLN to obtain 
      twin-like CMCS/SF-CLN and CMCS/M-IMD-CLN, respectively. The results of cellular 
      uptake assay on Hepa1-6 cells and RAW 264.7 cells in vitro, respectively, as well 
      as the results of tumor tissue distribution of SF and IMD-0354 in vivo suggested 
      that CMCS/SF-CLN and CMCS/M-IMD-CLN exhibited similar properties in vitro and 
      synchronous biodistribution in vivo, and were efficient at separated cell 
      targeting delivery. What's more, the results of antitumor efficiency in vivo and 
      phenotype analysis of TAM in tumor tissues proved that CMCS/SF-CLN and 
      CMCS/M-IMD-CLN exhibited superior synergistic antitumor efficacy and M2-type TAM 
      polarization ability compared with SF treatment in Hepa1-6 tumor bearing mice. 
      Consequently, TCN which was the combination of co-administration and nano-drug 
      delivery systems has great potential to be used in tumor-localized 
      chemoimmunotherapy in clinics.

PG  - 1468-1477
LID - 10.1111/liv.14113 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We assessed the activity of galunisertib, a small molecule 
      inhibitor of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β1) receptor I, in 
      second-line patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in two cohorts of 
      baseline serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP). METHODS: Patients with advanced HCC who 
      progressed on or were ineligible to receive sorafenib, Child-Pugh A/B7 and ECOG 
      PS ≤1 were enrolled into Part A (AFP ≥ 1.5× ULN) or Part B (AFP < 1.5× ULN). 
      Patients were treated with 80 or 150 mg galunisertib BID for 14 days per 28-day 
      cycle. Endpoints were time-to-progression (TTP) and changes in circulating AFP 
      and TGF-β1 levels, as well as safety, pharmacokinetics, progression-free survival 
      and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Patients (n = 149) were enrolled with median 
      age 65 years. Median TTP was 2.7 months (95% CI: 1.5-2.9) in Part A (n = 109) and 
      4.2 months (95% CI: 1.7-5.5) in Part B (n = 40). Median OS was 7.3 months (95% 
      CI: 4.9-10.5) in Part A and 16.8 months (95% CI: 10.5-24.4) in Part B. OS was 
      longer in AFP responders (>20% decrease from baseline, Part A) compared to 
      non-responders (21.5 months vs 6.8 months). OS was longer in TGF-β1 responders 
      (>20% decrease from baseline, all patients) compared to non-responders. The most 
      common Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (n = 4) and 
      fatigue, anaemia, increased bilirubin, hypoalbuminemia and embolism (each, 
      n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: Galunisertib treatment had a manageable safety profile in 
      patients with HCC. Lower baseline AFP and a response in AFP or TGF-β1 levels (vs 
      no response) correlated with longer survival. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 
      NCT01246986 at ClinicalTrials.gov.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The potential of S-1 for the treatment of metastatic renal cell 
      carcinoma (mRCC) has been shown in two phase II studies. We aimed to assess the 
      safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of S-1 combined with 
      sorafenib in patients with mRCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter, 
      single-arm, open-label, phase I/II study of S-1 plus sorafenib, we recruited 
      patients with clear-cell or papillary renal cell carcinoma who had received a 
      maximum of one prior cytokine-based regimen. The phase I primary end points were 
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD). S-1 was administered 
      orally at 60, 80, 100 or 120 mg/day on days 1-28 of a 42-day cycle in combination 
      with sorafenib (400 or 800 mg/day), given daily with dose adjustment. In phase 
      II, the primary end point was to assess the overall response rate (ORR) at the 
      RD. RESULTS: Nine patients were enrolled into phase I and 21 (including 6 
      patients who received the RD in the phase I portion) were enrolled into phase II. 
      In the phase I portion, the MTD could not be determined, and the RD was defined 
      as S-1 80 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-28 + sorafenib 800 mg/day on days 1-42. In the 
      phase II portion, 21 patients were fully assessable for efficacy and safety. The 
      confirmed ORR was 52% [95% confidence interval (CI) 29.8-74.3], including one 
      complete response (5%) and 10 partial responses (48%). The median 
      progression-free survival was 9.9 (95% CI 6.5-17.1) months. The most frequently 
      reported treatment-related adverse event for all grades was hand-foot skin 
      reaction (100%). The major reasons for dose reduction were hand-foot skin 
      reaction (38%) and rash (14%). CONCLUSION: Combination therapy with S-1 plus 
      sorafenib is effective and tolerable for patients with mRCC. However, skin events 
      management is important in S-1 plus sorafenib combination therapy.

TI  - Phase Ib study of codrituzumab in combination with sorafenib in patients with 
      non-curable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
PG  - 421-429
LID - 10.1007/s00280-017-3241-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Codrituzumab, a humanized antibody against glypican-3, is highly 
      expressed in HCC. A phase I study evaluated the combination with sorafenib in 
      HCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a 3 + 3 design, codrituzumab was given 
      intravenously in various doses with sorafenib 400 mg twice daily to patients with 
      advanced HCC, age ≥18, ECOG 0-1, Child-Pugh A and B7, adequate organ functions, 
      and no prior systemic therapy, with tumor assessment by RECIST 1.0 and safety by 
      CTCAE 3.0. PK and pre, during, and post-therapy (124)I radiolabeled codrituzumab 
      PET scan imaging were performed. RESULTS: 41 patients were enrolled: 2.5 mg/kg 
      weekly (qw) (12), 5 mg/kg qw (12), 10 mg/kg qw (3), 1600 mg every 2 weeks (q2w) 
      (6), and 1600 mg qw (7). Two drug limiting toxicities occurred: grade 3 
      hyponatremia at 5 mg/kg and grade 3 hyponatremia and hyperglycemia at 1600 mg 
      q2w. Adverse events occurred in 80% of patients, including at least one ≥grade 3: 
      ten (25%) increased AST, three (7.5%) increased ALT, and ten (25%) increased 
      lipase. There were no responses and nine (25.7%) had stable disease. PK C (max) 
      and AUC(t) of codrituzumab and sorafenib were comparable to single-agent data. 
      Thirteen out of 14 patients showed (124)I radiolabeled codrituzumab uptake in 
      tumor. In all three patients who underwent a post-progression PET, glypican-3 
      remained expressed. CONCLUSION: Codrituzumab plus sorafenib were tolerated at 
      1600 mg q2w and 400 mg bid, respectively, with no responses. Codrituzumab exerts 
      selective distribution to HCC cells, and GPC3 does not show any down-regulation 
      post-progression (NCT00976170).

AB  - A series of new VEGFR-2 inhibitors were designed, synthesized and evaluated for 
      their anti-proliferative activities against hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG-2 cell 
      line). Compound 29(b) (IC(50) = 4.33 ± 0.2 µg/ml) was found to be the most potent 
      derivative as it has showed to be more active than doxorubicin 
      (IC(50) = 4.50 ± 0.2 µg/ml) and 78% of sorafenib activity 
      (IC(50) = 3.40 ± 0.25 µg/ml). The inhibitory profiles against VEGFR-2 were also 
      assessed for the most promising candidates (16(b), 20(c), 22(b), 24(a), 24(b), 
      28(c), 28(e,) 29(a), 29(b) and 29(c)). Compounds 29(b), 29(c) and 29(a) exhibited 
      potent inhibitory activities towards VEGFR-2 at IC(50) values of 3.1 ± 0.04, 
      3.4 ± 0.05 and 3.7 ± 0.06 µM, respectively, comparing sorafenib 
      (IC(50) = 2.4 ± 0.05 µM). Furthermorer, compound 29(b) induced apoptosis and 
      arrested the cell cycle growth at G2/M phase. Additionally, in vivo antitumor 
      experiments revealed that compounds 29(b) and 29(c) have significant tumor growth 
      inhibition. The test of immuno-histochemical expression of activated caspase-3 
      revealed that there is a time-dependent increase in cleaved caspase-3 protein 
      expression upon exposure of HepG-2 cells to compound 29(b). Moreover, the 
      fibroblastic proliferative index test revealed that compound 29(b) could 
      attenuate liver fibrosis. Docking studies also supported the results concluded 
      from the biological screening via prediction of the possible binding interactions 
      of the target compounds with VEGFR-2 active sites using the crystal structure of 
      VEGFR-2 downloaded from the Protein Data Bank, (PDB ID: 2OH4) using Discovery 
      Studio 2.5 software. Further structural optimization of the most active 
      candidates may serve as a useful strategy for getting new lead compounds in 
      search for powerful and selective antineoplastic agents.

TI  - Phase II study of sorafenib in patients with metastatic or recurrent sarcomas.
PG  - 3133-40
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2008.20.4495 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE Since activity of sorafenib was observed in sarcoma patients in a phase I 
      study, we performed a multicenter phase II study of daily oral sorafenib in 
      patients with recurrent or metastatic sarcoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS We employed a 
      multiarm study design, each representing a sarcoma subtype with its own Simon 
      optimal two-stage design. In each arm, 12 patients who received 0 to 1 prior 
      lines of therapy were treated (0 to 3 for angiosarcoma and malignant 
      peripheral-nerve sheath tumor). If at least one Response Evaluation Criteria in 
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) was observed, 25 further patients with that sarcoma subtype 
      were accrued. Results Between October 2005 and November 2007, 145 patients were 
      treated; 144 were eligible for toxicity and 122 for response. Median age was 55 
      years; female-male ratio was 1.8:1. The median number of cycles was 3. Five of 37 
      patients with angiosarcoma had a partial response (response rate, 14%). This was 
      the only arm to meet the RECIST response rate primary end point. Median 
      progression-free survival was 3.2 months; median overall survival was 14.3 
      months. Adverse events (typically dermatological) necessitated dose reduction for 
      61% of patients. Statistical modeling in this limited patient cohort indicated 
      sorafenib toxicity was correlated inversely to patient height. There was no 
      correlation between phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase 
      expression and response in six patients with angiosarcoma with paired pre- and 
      post-therapy biopsies. CONCLUSION As a single agent, sorafenib has activity 
      against angiosarcoma and minimal activity against other sarcomas. Further 
      evaluation of sorafenib in these and possibly other sarcoma subtypes appears 
      warranted, presumably in combination with cytotoxic or kinase-specific agents.

TI  - Tyrosine kinase inhibitors noncompetitively inhibit MCT8-mediated iodothyronine 
      transport.
PG  - E100-5
LID - 10.1210/jc.2011-1837 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are used for the treatment of various 
      cancers. Case reports and clinical trials have reported abnormal thyroid function 
      tests (TFT) after treatment with sunitinib, imatinib, sorafenib, dasatinib, and 
      nilotinib. An increased requirement for levothyroxine was reported in 
      thyroidectomized patients during TKI treatment. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that 
      abnormal TFT are compatible with inhibition of thyroid hormone (TH) transporters 
      and subsequently reduced pituitary-TH feedback. Monocarboxylate transporter 8 
      (MCT8) is a TH transmembrane transporter in brain, pituitary, and other organs. 
      MCT8 mutation leads to abnormal TFT in patients and respective mouse models. We 
      tested whether TKI are able to inhibit MCT8-mediated TH uptake into cells. 
      DESIGN: Madin-Darby-canine kidney (MDCK1) cells stably expressing human MCT8 were 
      exposed in vitro to TKI at increasing concentrations, and MCT8-mediated 
      [(125)I]T(3) uptake and efflux were measured. The mode of inhibition was 
      determined. RESULTS: TKI exposure dose-dependently inhibited MCT8-dependent T(3) 
      and T(4) uptake. IC(50) values for sunitinib, imatinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib 
      ranged from 13-38 μm, i.e. similar to the Michaelis-Menten constant K(m) for T(3) 
      and T(4), 4 and 8 μm, respectively. Kinetic experiments revealed a noncompetitive 
      mode of inhibition for all TKI tested. CONCLUSIONS: Partial inhibition by TKI of 
      pituitary or hypothalamic TH feedback may increase TSH or increase the 
      levothyroxine requirement of thyroidectomized patients. It is still possible that 
      other mechanisms contribute to TKI-mediated impairments of TFT, e.g. altered 
      metabolism of TH. Bosutinib was not previously reported to alter TFT.

TI  - Effect of CYP3A-inducing anti-epileptics on sorafenib exposure: results of a 
      phase II study of sorafenib plus daily temozolomide in adults with recurrent 
      glioblastoma.
PG  - 57-66
LID - 10.1007/s11060-010-0217-6 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib, an oral VEGFR-2, Raf, PDGFR, c-KIT and Flt-3 inhibitor, is active 
      against renal cell and hepatocellular carcinomas, and has recently demonstrated 
      promising activity for lung and breast cancers. In addition, various protracted 
      temozolomide dosing schedules have been evaluated as a strategy to further 
      enhance its anti-tumor activity. We reasoned that sorafenib and protracted, daily 
      temozolomide may provide complementary therapeutic benefit, and therefore 
      performed a phase 2 trial among recurrent glioblastoma patients. Adult 
      glioblastoma patients at any recurrence after standard temozolomide 
      chemoradiotherapy received sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) and continuous daily 
      temozolomide (50 mg/m²/day). Assessments were performed every eight weeks. The 
      primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6) and secondary 
      end points were radiographic response, overall survival (OS), safety and 
      sorafenib pharmacokinetics. Of 32 enrolled patients, 12 (38%) were on CYP3-A 
      inducing anti-epileptics (EIAEDs), 17 (53%) had 2 or more prior progressions, 15 
      had progressed while receiving 5-day temozolomide, and 12 (38%) had failed either 
      prior bevacizumab or VEGFR inhibitor therapy. The most common grade ≥ 3 
      toxicities were palmer-planter erythrodysesthesia (19%) and elevated 
      amylase/lipase (13%). Sorafenib pharmacokinetic exposures were comparable on day 
      1 regardless of EIAED status, but significantly lower on day 28 for patients on 
      EIAEDs (P = 0.0431). With a median follow-up of 93 weeks, PFS-6 was 9.4%. Only 
      one patient (3%) achieved a partial response. In conclusion, sorafenib can be 
      safely administered with daily temozolomide, but this regimen has limited 
      activity for recurrent GBM. Co-administration of EIAEDs can lower sorafenib 
      exposures in this population.

AB  - Combining sorafenib and eribulin mesylate may provide synergistic antitumor 
      activities with limited overlapping toxicities. This phase 1b, open-label, 
      dose-escalation study evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics, maximum tolerated 
      dose/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D), and preliminary efficacy of sorafenib 
      plus standard-dose eribulin mesylate in patients with advanced, metastatic, or 
      refractory tumors. Patients received sorafenib 200 mg twice daily (BID; n = 5), 
      600 mg/day (n = 8), and 400 mg BID (MTD; n = 27). Dose-limiting toxicities were 
      increased alanine aminotransferase and acute coronary syndrome (both grade 3) in 
      the 400-mg BID dose-escalation and expansion cohorts, respectively. No 
      significant increase in mean QTcF duration was observed with eribulin plus 
      sorafenib versus eribulin alone; there were no drug-drug interactions. Five 
      patients achieved partial response; 16 achieved stable disease. The combination 
      of sorafenib and eribulin mesylate presented no unexpected safety concerns and no 
      significant impact on QT/QTc intervals or drug-drug interactions. Sorafenib 400 
      mg BID plus standard-dose eribulin is the RP2D.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preclinical models have reported a synergistic interaction between 
      sorafenib and vinorelbine. We investigated the toxicity, efficacy, and 
      pharmacokinetics interaction of this combination as first-line treatment for 
      patients with metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: Patients were HER2-negative and 
      treated with vinorelbine 30 mg/m2 IV days 1,8 every 21 plus daily oral sorafenib. 
      In the phase I portion (3+3 design) patients received sorafenib 200 mg BID 
      (cohort 1) or 400 mg BID (cohort 2). In the phase II expansion, 21 more evaluable 
      patients were planned to receive the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). 
      Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in 6 patients: blood concentrations were 
      compared for each drug in the presence or absence of the other drug. RESULTS: In 
      cohort 1, one patient experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) (grade 3 
      pancreatitis), requiring the expansion of this cohort to 6 patients, without 
      further documented DLTs. In cohort 2, one patient of six experienced a grade 4 
      DLT (asymptomatic rise in amylase not requiring drug discontinuation), 
      establishing this dose level as the MTD (sorafenib 400 mg BID). After expansion 
      at the MTD, a total of 27 patients (median age 57) were treated for a median of 8 
      cycles. One grade 5 febrile neutropenia occurred. With repeated cycles, 52% of 
      patients required at least 1 dose reduction of either drug. One patient 
      experienced a sustained grade 3 fatigue resulting in treatment discontinuation. 
      The response rate was 30%. Median PFS was 5.7 months (95% CI 4.4-7.6), and 
      clinical benefit (absence of disease progression at 6 months) was 48%. PK 
      analysis showed a significant interaction between the two drugs, resulting in a 
      higher Cmax of vinorelbine in the presence of sorafenib. CONCLUSION: The 
      combination of sorafenib and vinorelbine at full doses is feasible but not devoid 
      of toxicity, likely also due to a significant PK interaction. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00764972.

TI  - BCRP/ABCG2 inhibition sensitizes hepatocellular carcinoma cells to sorafenib.
PG  - e83627
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0083627 [doi]
LID - e83627
AB  - The multikinase inhibitor, sorafenib (Nexavar®, BAY43-9006), which inhibits both 
      the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), has shown 
      significantly therapeutic benefits in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
      However, not all HCC patients respond to sorafenib well and new therapeutic 
      strategies to optimize the efficacy of sorafenib are urgently required. 
      Overexpression of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) mediates the 
      drug-efflux of several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) to attenuate their 
      efficacy. This study aimed to investigate the role of BCRP/ABCG2 in the 
      sensitivity of HCC to sorafenib. Our data showed that BCRP/ABCG2 mediated the 
      efflux of sorafenib. Co-treatment with a BCRP/ABCG2 inhibitor greatly augmented 
      the cytotoxicity of sorafenib in HCC cells. Similar results were also achieved by 
      the competitive inhibitor of BCRP/ABCG2, gefitinib, in combination with 
      sorafenib. These results suggest not only that BCRP/ABCG2 is a potential 
      predictor for the sorafenib sensitivity in HCC, but also that blockage of 
      BCRP/ABCG2 may be a potential strategy to increase the response of HCC cells to 
      sorafenib.

AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor, which was approved as first-line 
      treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We conducted 
      a phase 1 study of sorafenib plus S-1 in patients with advanced HCC. EXPERIMENTAL 
      DESIGN: We designed to escalate S-1 at 4 different dose levels with fixed dose of 
      sorafenib. Four dose levels were as follows: level 1, D1-14 S-1 50 mg/m(2)/day + 
      D1-21 sorafenib 400 mg bid; level 2, D1-14 S-1 60 mg/m(2)/day + D1-21 sorafenib 
      400 mg bid; level 3,, D1-14 S-1 70 mg/m(2)/day + D1-21 sorafenib 400 mg bid; 
      level 4, D1-14 S-1 80 mg/m(2)/day + D1-21 sorafenib 400 mg bid. The treatment was 
      repeated every 3 weeks. RESULTS: From August 2009 to July 2010, 20 patients with 
      advanced HCC were enrolled. The median age was 48 years (range, 29-74). Eighteen 
      (90%) patients had hepatitis B viral infection and 19 (95%) patients were rated 
      as Child-Pugh class A. The dose-limiting toxicities were grade 4 infection and 
      thrombocytopenia. After a median follow-up duration of 8.6 months (range, 
      3.7-14.2 months), median PFS was 3.9 months (95% CI, 0.8-7.0 months) and median 
      OS was 10.4 months (95% CI, 0-22.4 months). In pharmacokinetic analysis, there 
      was no statistically significant drug interaction between sorafenib and S-1. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The combination of sorafenib and S-1 showed tolerable toxicity 
      profile and modest clinical efficacy in patients with advanced HCC. The 
      recommended dose of sorafenib and S-1 was 400 mg twice daily and 40 mg/m(2) twice 
      daily, respectively.

AB  - Protein kinases play important roles in tumor development and progression. Lots 
      of kinase inhibitors have entered into market and show promising clinical 
      benefits. Here we report the discovery of a novel small molecule, well-tolerated, 
      orally active kinase inhibitor, R1498, majorly targeting both angiogenic and 
      mitotic pathways for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and gastric 
      cancer (GC). A series of biochemical and cell-based assays indicated that the 
      target kinase cluster of R1498 included Aurora kinases and VEGFR2 et al. R1498 
      showed moderate in vitro growth inhibition on a panel of tumor cells with IC50 of 
      micromole range. The in vivo anti-tumor efficacy of R1498 was evaluated on a 
      panel of GC and HCC xenografts in a parallel comparison with another multikinase 
      inhibitor sorafenib. R1498 demonstrated superior efficacy and toxicity profile 
      over sorafenib in all test models with >80% tumor growth inhibition and tumor 
      regression in some xenogratfts. The therapeutic potential of R1498 was also 
      highlighted by its efficacy on three human GC primary tumor derived xenograft 
      models with 10-30% tumor regression rate. R1498 was shown to actively inhibit the 
      Aurora A activity in vivo, and decrease the vascularization in tumors. 
      Furthermore, R1498 presented good in vivo exposure and therapeutic window in the 
      pharmacokinetic and dose range finding studies. Theses evidences indicate that 
      R1498 is a potent, well-tolerated, orally active multitarget kinase inhibitor 
      with a unique antiangiogenic and antiproliferative profile, and provide strong 
      confidence for further development for HCC and GC therapy.

AB  - PURPOSE: Hypertension is a mechanism-based toxicity of sorafenib and other cancer 
      therapeutics that inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling 
      pathway. This prospective, single-center, cohort study characterized ambulatory 
      blood pressure monitoring as an early pharmacodynamic biomarker of VEGF signaling 
      pathway inhibition by sorafenib. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Fifty-four normotensive 
      advanced cancer patients underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring 
      before and between days 6 and 10 of sorafenib therapy. After blood pressure 
      changes were detected among the first cohort within 10 days, ambulatory blood 
      pressure monitoring was done during the first 24 hours of treatment for the 
      second cohort. RESULTS: For the entire patient population, the blood pressure 
      increase [mean systolic, +10.8 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 8.6-13.0; 
      range, -5.2 to +28.7 mm Hg; mean diastolic, +8.0 mm Hg; 95% CI, 6.3-9.7; range, 
      -4.4 to +27.1 mm Hg] was detected between days 6 and 10 (P < 0.0001 for both) and 
      plateaued thereafter. Variability in blood pressure change did not associate 
      with: age, body size, sex, self-reported race, baseline blood pressure, or 
      steady-state sorafenib plasma concentrations. In the second cohort, the blood 
      pressure elevation was detected during the first 24 hours (mean systolic, +8.2 mm 
      Hg; 95% CI, 5.0-11.3; mean diastolic, +6.5 mm Hg; 95% CI, 4.7-8.3; P < 0.0001 for 
      both). CONCLUSIONS: Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring detects the blood 
      pressure response to VEGF signaling pathway inhibition by sorafenib during the 
      first 24 hours of treatment. The magnitude of blood pressure elevation is highly 
      variable and unpredictable but could be important in optimizing the therapeutic 
      index of VEGF signaling pathway inhibitor therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in preventing 
      brain metastases in patients with renal cell carcinoma is unclear. METHODS: 
      Preclinical studies were conducted to determine the steady-state brain and plasma 
      concentrations of sorafenib and sunitinib in mice deficient in the drug efflux 
      transporters; p-glycoprotein, and breast cancer resistance protein. A 
      single-institution retrospective analysis of patients treated from 2008 to 2010 
      was conducted to assess the incidence of brain metastases before and during TKI 
      treatment. RESULTS: Transport of sorafenib and sunitinib across the blood-brain 
      barrier was restricted. Retrospective analysis revealed that the median time to 
      develop metastatic brain disease was 28 months (range, 1-108 months) while on TKI 
      therapy and 11.5 months (range, 0-64 months) in patients who did not receive TKI 
      therapy. The incidence of brain metastases per month in patients not treated with 
      TKI therapy was 1.6 higher than the incidence in patients treated with TKI 
      therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Penetration of sorafenib or sunitinib through an intact 
      blood-brain barrier to brain tissue is limited; however, the incidence of brain 
      metastases per unit time is decreased in patients on TKI therapy in comparison 
      with the "cytokine" era.

TI  - Results of a phase I trial of sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) in combination with 
      oxaliplatin in patients with refractory solid tumors, including colorectal 
      cancer.
PG  - 188-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006), a multiple kinase inhibitor, has been shown 
      to inhibit tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis by targeting Raf kinase, vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptor, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. 
      In phase I studies, sorafenib demonstrated single-agent activity in patients with 
      advanced solid tumors and was successfully combined with oxaliplatin in 
      preclinical studies. This phase I study investigated the safety, 
      pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of sorafenib in combination with oxaliplatin. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with refractory solid tumors were 
      enrolled in the initial dose-escalation part (cohorts 1, 2A, and 2B) and 10 
      additional patients with oxaliplatin-refractory colorectal cancer were 
      subsequently enrolled in an extension part (cohort 3). Oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 was 
      given on day 1 of a 3-week cycle and oral sorafenib was administered continuously 
      from day 4 of cycle 1 at 200 mg twice daily (cohort 1) or 400 mg twice daily 
      (cohorts 2A, 2B, and 3). RESULTS: Adverse events were generally mild to moderate 
      and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Common adverse events were 
      diarrhea (52% of patients in the dose-escalation part and 20% in the extension 
      part), sensory neuropathy (44% and 20%), and dermatologic toxicities (41% and 
      80%). No pharmacokinetic interaction between sorafenib and oxaliplatin was 
      detectable. Two patients with gastric cancer had a partial response. Forty-three 
      percent of patients in cohorts 1 and 2A/B and 78% of patients in cohort 3 
      exhibited stable disease for >or=10 weeks. CONCLUSION: Continuous oral sorafenib 
      400 mg twice daily was safely combined with oxaliplatin without detectable drug 
      interactions and showed preliminary antitumor activity in this phase I study. 
      This dose is recommended for phase II studies.

TI  - Monitoring metabolic response using FDG PET-CT during targeted therapy for 
      metastatic colorectal cancer.
PG  - 1792-801
LID - 10.1007/s00259-016-3365-x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The introduction of targeted drugs has had a significant impact on 
      the approach to assessing tumour response. These drugs often induce a rapid 
      cytostatic effect associated with a less pronounced and slower tumoural volume 
      reduction, thereby impairing the correlation between the absence of tumour 
      shrinkage and the patient's unlikelihood of benefit. The aim of the study was to 
      assess the predictive value of early metabolic response (mR) evaluation after one 
      cycle, and its interlesional heterogeneity to a later metabolic and morphological 
      response assessment performed after three cycles in metastatic colorectal cancer 
      (mCRC) patients treated with combined sorafenib and capecitabine. METHODS: This 
      substudy was performed within the framework of a wider prospective multicenter 
      study on the predictive value of early FDG PET-CT response assessment (SoMore 
      study). A lesion-based response analysis was performed, including all measurable 
      lesions identified on the baseline PET. On a per-patient basis, a descriptive 
      4-class response categorization was applied based upon the presence and 
      proportion of non-responding lesions. For dichotomic response comparison, all 
      patients with at least one resistant lesion were classified as non-responding. 
      RESULTS: On baseline FDG PET-CT, 124 measurable "target" lesions were identified 
      in 38 patients. Early mR assessments showed 18 patients (47 %) without treatment 
      resistant lesions and 12 patients (32 %) with interlesional response 
      heterogeneity. The NPV and PPV of early mR were 85 % (35/41) and 84 % (70/83), 
      respectively, on a per-lesion basis and 95 % (19/20) and 72 % (13/18), 
      respectively, on a dichotomized per-patient basis. CONCLUSIONS: Early mR 
      assessment performed after one cycle of sorafenib-capecitabine in mCRC is highly 
      predictive of non-response at a standard response assessment time. The high NPV 
      (95 %) of early mR could be useful as the basis for early treatment 
      discontinuation or adaptation to spare patients from exposure to non-effective 
      drugs.

TI  - Phase I dose-escalation study of plitidepsin in combination with sorafenib or 
      gemcitabine in patients with refractory solid tumors or lymphomas.
PG  - 341-349
LID - 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000457 [doi]
AB  - This phase I trial evaluated the combination of the marine-derived 
      cyclodepsipeptide plitidepsin (trade name Aplidin) with sorafenib or gemcitabine 
      in advanced cancer and lymphoma patients. The study included two treatment arms: 
      a sorafenib/plitidepsin (S/P) and a gemcitabine/plitidepsin (G/P) arm. In the S/P 
      arm, patients were treated orally with sorafenib continuous dosing at two dose 
      levels (DL1: 200 mg twice daily and DL2: 400 mg twice daily) combined with 
      plitidepsin (1.8 mg/m, day 1, day 8, day 15, and, q4wk, intravenously). In the 
      G/P arm, patients with solid tumors or lymphoma were treated at four different 
      DLs with a combination of gemcitabine (DL1: 750 mg/m, DL2-DL4: 1000 mg/m) and 
      plitidepsin (DL1-DL2: 1.8 mg/m; DL3: 2.4 mg/m; DL4: 3 mg/m). Both agents were 
      administered intravenously on day 1, day 8, day 15, and, q4wk. Forty-four 
      patients were evaluable for safety and toxicity. The safety of the combination of 
      plitidepsin with sorafenib or gemcitabine was manageable. Most adverse events 
      (AEs) were mild; no grade 4 treatment-related AEs were reported in any of the 
      groups (except for one grade 4 thrombocytopenia in the gemcitabine arm). The most 
      frequently reported study drug-related (or of unknown relationship) AEs were 
      palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, erythema, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue in the 
      S/P arm and nausea, fatigue, and vomiting in the G/P arm. In the S/P arm, one 
      dose-limiting toxicity occurred in two out of six patients treated at the maximum 
      dose tested (DL2): palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia and grade 2 aspartate 
      aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase increase that resulted in omission of 
      days 8 and 15 plitidepsin infusions. In the G/P arm, one dose-limiting toxicity 
      occurred in two out of six patients at DL4: grade 2 alanine aminotransferase 
      increase resulted in omission of days 8 and 15 plitidepsin infusions and grade 4 
      thrombocytopenia. The recommended dose for the combination of plitidepsin with 
      sorafenib was not defined because of a sponsor decision (no expansion cohort to 
      confirm) and for plitidepsin with gemcitabine, it was 2.4 mg/m plitidepsin with 
      1000 mg/m gemcitabine. In the S/P group, objective disease responses were not 
      observed; however, disease stabilization (≥3months) was observed in four 
      patients. In the gemcitabine group, two lymphoma patients showed an objective 
      response (partial response and complete response) and nine patients showed 
      disease stabilization (≥3months). Combining plitidepsin with gemcitabine and 
      sorafenib is feasible for advanced cancer patients; some objective responses were 
      observed in heavily pretreated lymphoma patients.

TI  - Antitumor activity of a novel oral signal transducer and activator of 
      transcription 3 inhibitor YHO-1701.
PG  - 1774-1784
LID - 10.1111/cas.14369 [doi]
AB  - The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway 
      is a key mediator of cancer cell proliferation, survival and invasion. Aberrant 
      STAT3 has been demonstrated in various malignant cancers. YHO-1701 is a novel 
      quinolinecarboxamide derivative generated from STX-0119. Here, we examined the 
      effect of YHO-1701 on STAT3 and evaluated antitumor activity of YHO-1701 as a 
      single agent and in combination. YHO-1701 inhibited STAT3-SH2 binding to 
      phospho-Tyr peptide selectively and more potently than STX-0119 in biochemical 
      assays. Molecular docking studies with STAT3 suggested more stable interaction of 
      YHO-1701 with the SH2 domain. YHO-1701 exhibited approximately 10-fold stronger 
      activity than STX-0119 in abrogating the STAT3 signaling pathway of human oral 
      cancer cell line SAS. YHO-1701 also blocked multi-step events by inhibiting STAT3 
      dimerization and suppressed STAT3 promoter activity. As expected, YHO-1701 
      exerted strong antiproliferative activity against human cancer cell lines 
      addicted to STAT3 signaling. Orally administered YHO-1701 showed statistically 
      significant antitumor effects with long exposure to high levels of YHO-1701 at 
      tumor sites in SAS xenograft models. Moreover, combination regimen with sorafenib 
      led to significantly stronger antitumor activity. In addition, the suppression 
      level of survivin (a downstream target) was superior for the combination as 
      compared with monotherapy groups within tumor tissues. Thus, YHO-1701 had a 
      favorable specificity for STAT3 and pharmacokinetics after oral treatment; it 
      also contributed to the enhanced antitumor activity of sorafenib. The evidence 
      presented here provides justification using for this approach in future clinical 
      settings.

TI  - Phase 1 trial of tivantinib in combination with sorafenib in adult patients with 
      advanced solid tumors.
PG  - 159-68
LID - 10.1007/s10637-014-0167-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This phase I study evaluated the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated 
      dose (MTD), and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of tivantinib combined with 
      sorafenib in patients with advanced solid tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 
      standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design was used. At the RP2D, expansion cohorts in 
      5 tumor types could be enrolled. Pharmacogenetic and pharmacodynamic analysis 
      were performed. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients received the study treatment. The 
      combination had no unexpected toxicities. The most common treatment-related 
      adverse events (AE) were rash (40 %), diarrhea (38 %), and anorexia (33 %). The 
      RP2D was tivantinib 360 mg BID and sorafenib 400 mg BID for all cancer 
      histologies, except in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients tivantinib was 240 
      mg BID plus sorafenib 400 mg BID. The overall response rate was 12 % in all 
      patients, 26 % in melanoma, 15 % in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), 10 % in HCC, and 
      0 % in other patients. Disease control rate (CR, PR and SD ≥8 weeks) was 58 % in 
      all patients, 90 % in RCC, 65 % in HCC, 63 % in melanoma, 40 % in breast cancer, 
      and 8 % in NSCLC patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combination treatment could be 
      administered at full standard single-agent doses in all patients except those 
      with HCC, where tivantinib was lowered to 240 mg BID. Preliminary evidence of 
      anticancer activity was observed in patients with RCC, HCC, and melanoma, 
      including patients refractory to sorafenib and/or other anti-VEGF pathway 
      therapies. The combination treatment has therapeutic potential in treating a 
      variety of solid tumors.

TI  - A phase I multi-institutional study of systemic sorafenib in conjunction with 
      regional melphalan for in-transit melanoma of the extremity.
PG  - 3896-3905
LID - 10.1245/s10434-012-2373-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Isolated limb infusion with melphalan (ILI-M) corrected for ideal 
      body weight (IBW) is a well-tolerated treatment for patients with in-transit 
      extremity melanoma with an approximate 29 % complete response (CR) rate. 
      Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, has been shown to augment tumor response to 
      chemotherapy in preclinical studies. METHODS: A multi-institutional, 
      dose-escalation, phase I study was performed to evaluate the safety and antitumor 
      activity of sorafenib in combination with ILI-M. Patients with AJCC stage 
      IIIB/IIIC/IV melanoma were treated with sorafenib starting at 400 mg daily for 
      7 days before and 7 days after ILI-M corrected for IBW. Toxicity, drug 
      pharmacokinetics, and tumor protein expression changes were measured and 
      correlated with clinical response at 3 months. RESULTS: A total of 20 patients 
      were enrolled at two institutions. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sorafenib 
      in combination with ILI-M was 400 mg. Four dose-limiting toxicities occurred, 
      including soft tissue ulcerations and compartment syndrome. There were three CRs 
      (15 %) and four partial responses (20 %). Of patients with the Braf mutation, 
      83 % (n = 6) progressed compared with only 33 % without (n = 12). Short-term 
      sorafenib treatment did alter protein expression as measured with reverse phase 
      protein array (RPPA) analysis, but did not inhibit protein expression in the MAP 
      kinase pathway. Sorafenib did not alter melphalan pharmacokinetics. CONCLUSION: 
      This trial defined the MTD of systemically administered sorafenib in combination 
      with ILI-M. Although some responses were seen, the addition of sorafenib to ILI-M 
      did not appear to augment the effects of melphalan but did increase regional 
      toxicity.

TI  - A phase II clinical trial of sorafenib in androgen-independent prostate cancer.
PG  - 209-14
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1355 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine if sorafenib is associated with a 4-month probability of 
      progression-free survival, which is consistent with 50%, as determined by 
      clinical, radiographic, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) criteria in patients 
      with metastatic androgen-independent prostate cancer (AIPC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: 
      Patients with progressive metastatic AIPC were enrolled in an open-label, 
      single-arm phase II study. Sorafenib was given continuously at a dose of 400 mg 
      orally twice daily in 28-day cycles. Clinical assessment and PSA measurement were 
      done every cycle whereas radiographic measurements were carried out every two 
      cycles. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were enrolled in the study to date, 
      completing a planned first stage of the trial. Baseline patient characteristics 
      included a median age of 63.9 years (range, 50-77 years), Gleason score of 9 
      (range, 4-9.5), and PSA concentration of 53.3 ng/mL (range, 2-1,905 ng/mL). 
      Fifty-nine percent of patients had received one prior chemotherapy regimen. Of 
      the 21 patients with progressive disease, 13 progressed only by PSA criteria in 
      the absence of evidence of clinical and radiographic progression. Two patients 
      were found to have dramatic reduction of bone metastatic lesions as shown by bone 
      scan, although they met PSA progression criteria at the time when scans were 
      obtained. Toxicities likely related to treatment included one grade 3 
      hypertension; one grade 3 hand-foot syndrome; and grade 1/2 toxicities: fatigue, 
      anorexia, hypertension, skin rash, nausea, and diarrhea. Results from in vitro 
      studies suggested that PSA is not a good marker of sorafenib activity. The 
      geometric mean exposure (AUC(0-12)) and maximum concentration (C(max)) were 9.76 
      h mg/L and 1.28 mg/L, respectively. The time to maximum concentration (t(max)) 
      and accumulation ratio (after second dose) ranged from 2 to 12 h and 0.68 to 
      6.43, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib is relatively well tolerated in AIPC 
      with two patients showing evidence of improved bony metastatic lesions. 
      Interpretation of this study is complicated by discordant radiographic and PSA 
      responses. PSA may not be an adequate biomarker for monitoring sorafenib 
      activity. Based on these observations, further investigation using only clinical 
      and radiographic end points as progression criteria is warranted. Accrual to the 
      second stage of trial is ongoing.

TI  - Quinacrine sensitizes hepatocellular carcinoma cells to TRAIL and 
      chemotherapeutic agents.
PG  - 229-38
AB  - Quinacrine has been widely explored in treatment of malaria, giardiasis, and 
      rheumatic diseases. We find that quinacrine stabilizes p53 and induces 
      p53-dependent and independent cell death. Treatment by quinacrine alone at 
      concentrations of 10-20 mM for 1-2 d cannot kill hepatocellular carcinoma cells, 
      such as HepG2, Hep3B, Huh7, which are also resistant to TRAIL. However, 
      quinacrine renders these cells sensitive to treatment by TRAIL. Co-treatment of 
      these cells with quinacrine and TRAIL induces overwhelming cell death within 3-4 
      h. Levels of DR5, a pro-apoptotic death receptor of TRAIL, are increased upon 
      treatment with quinacrine, while levels of Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic member of the 
      Bcl-2 family, are decreased. While the synergistic effect of quinacrine with 
      TRAIL appears to be in part independent of p53, knockdown of p53 in HepG2 cells 
      by siRNA results in more cell death after treatment by quinacrine and TRAIL. The 
      mechanism by which quinacrine sensitizes hepatocellular carcinoma cells to TRAIL 
      and chemotherapies, and the potential for clinical application currently are 
      being further explored. Lastly, quinacrine synergizes with chemotherapeutics, 
      such as adriamycin, 5-FU, etoposide, CPT11, sorafenib, and gemcitabine, in 
      killing hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and the drug enhances the 
      activity of sorafenib to delay tumor growth in vivo.

TI  - Phase I trial of sorafenib in combination with interferon-alpha in Japanese 
      patients with unresectable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
PG  - 1046-54
LID - 10.1007/s10637-010-9630-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the safety, pharmacokinetics, tumor response, and 
      immunological parameters of sorafenib plus interferon α-2b [corrected] (IFN) in 
      Japanese patients with advanced RCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After 2 weeks of 
      IFN-alone treatment, eligible patients received 28-day cycles of continuous 
      sorafenib 200 mg (Cohort 1) or 400 mg (Cohorts 2 and 3) twice daily combined with 
      intramuscular IFN 6 (Cohorts 1 and 2) or 9 (Cohort 3) million international units 
      (MIU) three times a week. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients received at least one 
      dose of sorafenib plus IFN. Five patients had dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). 
      The most common DLT was fatigue, experienced in four DLT patients. All 18 
      patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (AE). The most 
      common treatment-emergent AEs included fatigue, fever, platelets, leukocytes, 
      hemoglobin, weight loss and anorexia. Five patients had confirmed partial 
      response and 11 had stable disease, a response rate of 27.8%. IFN had no relevant 
      impact on the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib administered 
      in combination with IFN was well tolerated, with promising results in efficacy. 
      Continuous sorafenib 400 mg twice daily in combination with IFN 6 MIU three times 
      a week is recommended in Japanese patients with advanced RCC.

AB  - Small-molecule inhibitors are promising antitumor drugs. We have designed and 
      synthesized a novel multi-targeted inhibitor, 
      2-methylcarbamoyl-4-{4-[3-(trifluoro-methyl)benzamido]phenoxy}pyridinium 
      (SKLB610), that potently inhibits human tumor growth. In the study, the 
      pharmacokinetic profile of SKLB610 was investigated. A simple, rapid and 
      sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection method was 
      developed for the determination of SKLB610 in rat plasma. Samples were extracted 
      with methanol and SKLB610 was separated on a C18 column using a mobile phase 
      system consisting of 55% acetonitrile and 45% water, with ultraviolet detection 
      at 270 nm. Sorafenib was used as the internal standard. The retention times of 
      SKLB610 and the internal standard were 5.6 and 8.1 min, respectively. The 
      quantification limit was 67 ng/mL. The calibration curves were linear over a 
      concentration range of 0.1-50 µg/mL. The inter-day and intra-day accuracy and 
      precision were within ± 10%. The recovery and stability of the assay were 
      evaluated from spiked rat plasma. The method was successfully applied to a 
      pharmacokinetic study of SKLB610 in rats. The pharmacokinetic profile of SKLB610 
      indicated that the oral formulations should be further optimized to improve 
      bioavailability and intravenous formulation of SKLB610 should be developed.

TI  - Discrimination of hand-foot skin reaction caused by tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
      based on direct keratinocyte toxicity and vascular endothelial growth factor 
      receptor-2 inhibition.

AB  - Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are molecular-targeted anticancer drugs. Their 
      benefits are limited by dermal toxicities, including hand-foot skin reaction 
      (HFSR), which is commonly found in skin areas subjected to friction. The present 
      study aimed to explain the incidence of HFSR in patients treated with TKIs by 
      focusing on keratinocyte toxicity and inhibition of vascular endothelial growth 
      factor receptor (VEGFR), which plays an essential role in angiogenesis. Mice with 
      gene knockout for the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-10 exhibited 
      HFSR-like phenotypes, such as cytotoxicity in keratinocytes and increased number 
      and size of blood vessels after repeated doses of regorafenib, sorafenib, and 
      pazopanib, all of which cause high incidence of HFSR, in combination with 
      tape-stripping mimicking skin damage at the friction site. Comprehensive 
      examination of the direct cytotoxic effects of 21 TKIs on primary cultured human 
      keratinocytes revealed that 18 of them reduced the cell viability 
      dose-dependently. Importantly, the ratio of the trough concentration in patients 
      (C(trough)) to the LC(50) values of cell viability reduction was higher than 
      unity for four HFSR-inducing TKIs, suggesting that these TKIs cause keratinocyte 
      toxicity at clinically relevant concentrations. In addition, eight HFSR-inducing 
      TKIs caused inhibition of VEGFR-2 kinase activity, which was validated by their 
      ratios of C(trough) to the obtained IC(50,VEGFR-2) of more than unity. All 12 
      TKIs with no reported incidence of HFSR exhibited less than unity values for both 
      C(trough)/LC(50,keratinocytes) and C(trough)/IC(50,VEGFR-2). These results 
      suggested that a combination of keratinocyte toxicity and VEGFR-2 inhibition may 
      explain the incidence of HFSR upon TKI usage in humans.

TI  - A phase 1b study of transforming growth factor-beta receptor I inhibitor 
      galunisertib in combination with sorafenib in Japanese patients with unresectable 
      hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 118-126
LID - 10.1007/s10637-018-0636-3 [doi]
AB  - Background Galunisertib inhibits type I transforming growth factor-beta receptor 
      serine/threonine kinase. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the 
      safety and tolerability of galunisertib in combination with sorafenib in Japanese 
      patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients and methods This 
      open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter, nonrandomized phase 1b study consisted 
      of two dose levels of galunisertib, 160 or 300 mg/day, in combination with 
      sorafenib 800 mg/day. Galunisertib 80 mg or 150 mg was administered orally twice 
      daily for 14 days followed by 14 days of rest plus sorafenib 400 mg administered 
      orally twice daily for 28 days. The dose-limiting toxicity evaluation was 28 days 
      after the first dose. Safety measures, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity 
      were assessed. Results Fourteen patients, 7 at each galunisertib dose, were 
      enrolled and treated. Three dose-limiting toxicities were reported for 2 
      patients. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were 
      hypophosphatemia (14 patients [100%]), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome 
      (12 patients [85.7%]), and decreased platelet count (10 patients [71.4%]). The 
      most common grade ≥ 3 TEAEs were hypophosphatemia (10 patients [71.4%]) and 
      palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (7 patients [50.0%]). No grade 5 TEAEs 
      were reported. The pharmacokinetic profile of galunisertib in combination with 
      sorafenib was similar to that previously reported for galunisertib. Eleven 
      patients had a best overall response of stable disease, and 1 patient achieved a 
      partial response by hepatocellular carcinoma-specific modified RECIST. 
      Conclusions These data are consistent with the known safety profile for 
      galunisertib and sorafenib and confirm tolerability of the recommended dose of 
      galunisertib (150 mg twice daily for 14 days) in combination with sorafenib in 
      Japanese patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

TI  - Multilayer-Coated Liquid Crystalline Nanoparticles for Effective Sorafenib 
      Delivery to Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 20360-8
LID - 10.1021/acsami.5b06203 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most common cancers in adults and develops 
      due to activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. 
      Sorafenib (SF) is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for the 
      treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, its clinical use is limited by 
      its poor aqueous solubility and undesirable side effects. Monoolein-based liquid 
      crystalline nanoparticles (LCN) are self-assembled structures that have been 
      determined as promising drug-delivery vehicles. Therefore, the main aim of this 
      study was to prepare layer-by-layer (LbL) polymer-assembled SF-loaded LCNs 
      (LbL-LCN/SF) for effective delivery of SF to hepatocellular carcinoma. Results 
      revealed that LbL-LCN/SF presented optimum particle size (∼165 nm) and 
      polydispersity index (PDI, ∼0.14) with appropriate polymer layer assembly 
      confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy 
      (AFM). Furthermore, LbL-LCN/SF effectively controlled burst release and exhibited 
      pH-sensitive release of SF, thereby increasing drug release in the acidic 
      microenvironment of tumor cells. Compared to free SF and bare LCN, the hemolytic 
      activity of LbL-LCN/SF was significantly reduced (p<0.01). Interestingly, 
      LbL-LCN/SF was more cytotoxic to HepG2 cells than the free drug was. 
      Additionally, high cellular uptake and greater apoptotic effects of LbL-LCN/SF in 
      HepG2 cells indicates superior antitumor effects. Therefore, LbL-LCN/SF is a 
      potentially effective formulation for hepatocellular carcinoma.

      advanced sarcoma: a Spanish group for research on sarcomas (GEIS) study.
PG  - 287-94
LID - 10.1007/s10637-013-9989-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This phase I trial assessed safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), dose 
      limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose (RD) of the 
      combination of sorafenib plus ifosfamide in patients with advanced sarcoma. 
      METHODS: Twelve sarcoma patients (9 soft-tissue, 3 bone sarcoma) were treated 
      with sorafenib plus ifosfamide (starting doses 200 mg bid and 6 g/m(2) 
      respectively). A 3 + 3 dose escalation design with cohorts of 3-6 patients was 
      used. A study to assess the in vitro efficacy of the combination was also 
      conducted. RESULTS: Three DLTs were observed: fatigue grade 4 with sorafenib 400 
      mg bid plus ifosfamide 6 g/m(2) and encephalopathy and emesis grade 3 with 
      sorafenib 400 mg bid plus ifosfamide 7.5 g/m(2). Other toxicities included 
      diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome, mucositis, neutropenia, skin rash and 
      thrombocytopenia. There were no relevant effects on PK of sorafenib but an 
      increase in ifosfamide active metabolite 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide was observed. Eight 
      patients achieved stable disease lasting more than 12 weeks. An additive effect 
      was observed in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: RD was sorafenib 400 mg bid plus ifosfamide 6 
      g/m(2), allowing administration of active doses of both agents. Limited 
      preliminary antitumor activity was also observed. A phase II study is currently 
      ongoing.

AB  - The current study aimed to develop PEGylated trimethyl chitosan (TMC) coated 
      emulsomes (EMs) conjugated with octreotide for targeted delivery of sorafenib to 
      hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCC) of HepG2. Sorafenib loaded TMC coated EMs 
      were prepared by the emulsion evaporation method and characterized concerning 
      particle size, zeta potential, drug encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro drug 
      release. Synthesized EMs were then conjugated to octreotide. The cytotoxicity of 
      the targeted and non-targeted EMs was determined by cellular uptake and MTT assay 
      on HepG2 cell. Cell cycle assay was also studied using flow cytometry. The 
      results showed the optimized EMs had the particle size of 127 nm, zeta potential 
      of -5.41 mV, loading efficiency of 95%, and drug release efficiency of 62% within 
      52 h. Octreotide was attached efficiently to the surface of EMs as much as 71%. 
      MTT assay and cellular uptake studies showed that targeted EMs had more 
      cytotoxicity than free sorafenib and non-targeted EMs. Cell cycle analyses 
      revealed that there was a significant more accumulation of targeted EMs treated 
      HepG2 cells in the G1 phase than free sorafenib and non-targeted EMs. The results 
      indicate that designed EMs may be promising for the treatment of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma.

AB  - Nanomedicines have made significant progress in the delivery of small molecular 
      drugs, many challenges, however, still remain to be overcome, such as 
      unsatisfactory drug loading, formulation instability, premature drug leakage, and 
      poor blood circulation. Herein, an innovative glutathione (GSH)-sensitive 
      amphiphilic dendritic prodrug with quantitative and high drug loading (>30 wt%) 
      is reported. The multi-armed structure of prepared prodrug can self-assemble into 
      nanoparticles in aqueous solution without the introduction of any organic 
      solvents. The self-assembled prodrug nanoparticle is composed of the following 
      key components: (i) polyethylene glycol (PEG) outer shell ensuring 
      biocompatibility and prolonging blood circulation, (ii) prodrug inner core 
      responding to GSH for triggered release of intact drug, (iii) multi-armed 
      dendritic structure facilitating self-assembly and enhancing drug loading 
      content, (iv) covalent drug conjugation avoiding drug leakage and improving 
      stability, (v) defined chemical structures and quantitative drug loading easy for 
      reproduction. Both in vitro and in vivo results show that these GSH-responsive 
      prodrug nanoparticle exhibits significant inhibition of tumor cell growth, and is 
      promising for efficient and safe chemotherapeutic delivery.

TI  - Sorafenib has soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitory activity, which contributes to 
      its effect profile in vivo.
PG  - 2193-203

AB  - The advent of multikinase inhibitors targeting the vascular endothelial growth 
      factor (VEGF) receptor has revolutionized the treatment of highly angiogenic 
      malignancies such as renal cell carcinoma. Interestingly, several such inhibitors 
      are commercially available, and they each possess diverse specific beneficial and 
      adverse effect profiles. In examining the structure of sorafenib, it was 
      hypothesized that this compound would possess inhibitory effects on the soluble 
      epoxide hydrolase, an enzyme with pleiotropic effects on inflammation and 
      vascular disease. We now show that sorafenib but not another VEGF receptor 
      targeted inhibitor sunitinib is a potent inhibitor of the human soluble epoxide 
      hydrolase in vitro (K(I) = 17 +/- 4 nmol/L). Furthermore, sorafenib causes the 
      expected in vivo shift in oxylipid profile resulting from soluble epoxide 
      hydrolase inhibition, evidence of a reduction in the acute inflammatory response. 
      Lipopolysaccharide-induced hypotension was reversed with sorafenib but not 
      sunitinib treatment, suggesting that soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibition 
      accounts for at least part of the anti-inflammatory effect of sorafenib. The 
      pharmacokinetic studies presented here in light of the known potency of sorafenib 
      as a soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor indicate that the soluble epoxide 
      hydrolase will be largely inhibited at therapeutic doses of sorafenib. Thus, it 
      is likely that soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibition contributes to the beneficial 
      effects from the inhibition of the VEGF receptor and other kinases during 
      treatment with sorafenib.

TI  - Towards better combination regimens of cytarabine and FLT3 inhibitors in acute 
      myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 325-337
LID - 10.1007/s00280-020-04114-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: AML patients with FLT3/ITD mutations have poor response to 
      cytarabine-based chemotherapy. FLT3 inhibitors (FLT3i) may resensitize cells to 
      cytarabine (CYT). Improving treatment outcome of this combination may benefit 
      from a mechanistic extrapolation approach from in vitro data. METHODS: The 
      effects of CYT and several FLT3i on cell proliferation and cell cycle kinetics 
      were examined in AML cell lines. The effect of FLT3i (quizartinib, midostaurin, 
      sorafenib) on cell proliferation and cell cycle kinetics was assessed in AML cell 
      lines with differing FLT3 status; HEL (negligible expression of wild-type FLT3), 
      EOL1 (wild-type FLT3), MV4-11 (FLT3-ITD resulting in constitutively active 
      isoform). Semi-mechanistic cell cycle models for CYT and FLT3i were developed. 
      Clinical CYT and quizartinib pharmacokinetic dosage regimens were modeled. 
      Survival of AML patients was described via a hazard model. Simulations exploring 
      different CYT/quizartinib regimens were conducted with the goal of improving 
      treatment outcome. RESULTS: FLT3 status was associated with sensitivity to CYT 
      (HEL cells most sensitive > EOL1 > MV4-11 cells). This order of sensitivity is 
      reversed for FLT3i. Cytarabine induced apoptosis in the S-phase while all FLT3i 
      induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. Simulations of candidate 
      clinical regimens predict better cell kill upon adding quizartinib simultaneously 
      with or immediately after CYT exposure. Overall survival was predicted to be 
      significantly better with quizartinib 200 mg administered every 48 h vs every 
      24 h in patients with FLT3 aberrations. CONCLUSION: Simultaneous administration 
      of quizartinib and CYT every other day is a promising combination regimen for AML 
      patients with FLT3 mutations.

TI  - Sorafenib in elderly patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a case 
      series.
PG  - 265-72
LID - 10.1159/000345558 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in elderly patients 
      is significantly more complicated than in younger patients because of medical 
      comorbidities, advanced status at diagnosis, reduced liver function and altered 
      drug pharmacokinetics. Our objective was a revision of the charts of unselected 
      elderly patients with HCC being treated with a reduced starting dose of 
      sorafenib. METHODS: Activity, adverse events and quality of life were evaluated 
      during the treatment. Sixty patients (47 males and 13 females) aged more than 70 
      years old (range 70-90, median 76 years) were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: 
      One complete and one partial response were achieved in the series (overall 
      response rate 3.3%). Stable disease accounted for 76.6% (46 out of 60 patients). 
      The disease control rate (complete plus partial response plus stable disease) was 
      80%. Median time to progression (TTP) was 7.0 months (95% CI, 5.2-8.7 months) and 
      median survival was 10.0 months (95% CI, 5.0-14.9 months). Thrombosis correlated 
      to TTP. Full doses of sora-fenib were reached in 11 out of 60 patients (18.3%). 
      The evaluation of quality of life did not show any significant change during the 
      study. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib at a reduced dose can be safely used in elderly HCC 
      patients with maintenance of activity and increased tolerability.

TI  - Inhibition of sodium-independent and sodium-dependent nucleobase transport 
      activities by tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
PG  - 1093-8
LID - 10.1007/s00280-015-2859-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) on equilibrative nucleobase 
      transport (ENBT) and sodium-dependent nucleobase transport (SNBT) activities were 
      investigated in normal human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (hRPTECs) and 
      in pig kidney cell line (LLC-PK1). METHODS: Uptake assays were performed by 
      assessing accumulation of radiolabeled nucleobases over time into hRPTECs or 
      LLC-PK1 cell lines which express ENBT and SNBT activities, respectively. 
      Dose-response curves for inhibition of 1 µM [(3)H]adenine or 1 µM 
      [(3)H]hypoxanthine were examined in hRPTECs and in LLC-PK1 cells with varying TKI 
      concentrations (0-100 µM) to calculate the IC50 values (mean ± S.E) for 
      inhibition. RESULTS: Gefitinib inhibited ENBT activity with an IC50 value of 0.7 
      µM, thus indicating strong interactions of ENBT with gefitinib in hRPTECs. 
      Erlotinib > sorafenib > imatinib > sunitinib inhibited ENBT with IC50 values of 
      15, 40, 60, 78 µM, respectively, whereas dasatinib, lapatinib, and vandetanib 
      were not inhibitory at concentrations >100 µM. Similar studies in LLC-PK1 cells 
      which exhibit SNBT activity showed that vandetanib was the most potent inhibitor 
      followed by sorafenib > erlotinib > gefitinib > sunitinib > imatinib with IC50 
      values of 14, 25, 28, 40, 47, 94 µM, respectively, whereas dasatinib and 
      lapatinib were not inhibitory at concentrations >100 µM. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results suggest for the first time inhibition of both ENBT and SNBT transport 
      activities by TKIs. These results suggest that it is important to consider 
      potential effects on combination regimens using TKIs with nucleobase drugs such 
      as 5-FU in cancer treatment.

TI  - Discovery of T-1101 tosylate as a first-in-class clinical candidate for Hec1/Nek2 
      inhibition in cancer therapy.

AB  - Highly expressed in cancer 1 (Hec1) plays an essential role in mitosis and is 
      correlated with cancer formation, progression, and survival. Phosphorylation of 
      Hec1 by Nek2 kinase is essential for its mitotic function, thus any disruption of 
      Hec1/Nek2 protein-protein interaction has potential for cancer therapy. We have 
      developed T-1101 tosylate (9j tosylate, 9j formerly known as TAI-95), optimized 
      from 4-aryl-N-pyridinylcarbonyl-2-aminothiazole of scaffold 9 by introducing 
      various C-4' substituents to enhance potency and water solubility, as a 
      first-in-class oral clinical candidate for Hec1 inhibition with potential for 
      cancer therapy. T-1101 has good oral absorption, along with potent in vitro 
      antiproliferative activity (IC(50): 14.8-21.5 nM). It can achieve high 
      concentrations in Huh-7 and MDA-MB-231 tumor tissues, and showed promise in 
      antitumor activity in mice bearing human tumor xenografts of liver cancer 
      (Huh-7), as well as of breast cancer (BT474, MDA-MB-231, and MCF7) with oral 
      administration. Oral co-administration of T-1101 halved the dose of sorafenib 
      (25 mg/kg to 12.5 mg/kg) required to exhibit comparable in vivo activity towards 
      Huh-7 xenografts. Cellular events resulting from Hec1/Nek2 inhibition with T-1101 
      treatment include Nek2 degradation, chromosomal misalignment, and apoptotic cell 
      death. A combination of T-1101 with either of doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and 
      topotecan in select cancer cells also resulted in synergistic effects. Inactivity 
      of T-1101 on non-cancerous cells, a panel of kinases, and hERG demonstrates 
      cancer specificity, target specificity, and cardiac safety, respectively. 
      Subsequent salt screening showed that T-1101 tosylate has good oral AUC 
      (62.5 μM·h), bioavailability (F = 77.4%), and thermal stability. T-1101 tosylate 
      is currently in phase I clinical trials as an orally administered drug for cancer 
      therapy.

AB  - Vinyl alcohol (VA) copolymers having fine tunable polarities are emerging 
      materials in drug delivery applications. VA copolymers rendering well-defined 
      molecular architecture (C/OH ratio = 2, 4, 5 and 8) were used as carriers for 
      model drug compound, fluorescein, which exhibited significantly different release 
      characteristics depending on the polarity of the polymers. Based on the 
      preliminary drug release tests the well-defined VA copolymer having C/OH = 5 
      ratio, poly(vinyl alcohol alt-propenylene) copolymer (PVA-5) was selected for 
      nanocomposite synthesis. Sorafenib anticancer drug was embedded into PVA-5 
      (C/OH = 5 ratio) nanoparticles by nanoprecipitation resulting in nanoparticles 
      exhibiting unusual cubic shape. The sorafenib-loaded nanocomposites showed 
      continuous release during a day and concentration-dependant cytotoxicity on HT-29 
      cancer cells. This might be interpreted by the sustained release of the drug.

TI  - Phase I Dose-Finding Study of OPB-111077, a Novel STAT3 Inhibitor, in Patients 
      with Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 510-518
LID - 10.4143/crt.2018.226 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling 
      pathway might be a promising therapeutic target for hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a multicenter, open-label, 
      non-comparative, dose escalating phase I study of OPB-111077, an oral STAT3 
      inhibitor, in patients with advanced HCC who failed on sorafenib. Continuous 
      dosing (daily administration, 50 to 400 mg) and intermittent dosing (4-days 
      on/3-days off administration: 300 to 900 mg) regimens were evaluated and the 
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended 
      dose (RD) were the primary endpoints. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients (19 for 
      continuous dosing and 14 for intermittent dosing) were enrolled. One patient 
      experienced a DLT with grade 3 dizziness, but the MTD was identified in neither 
      the continuous nor the intermittent dosing cohorts. The RDs were determined to be 
      250 mg for the continuous dosing regimen and 600 mg for the intermittent dosing 
      regimen. There was no treatment-related death; five patients (15.2%) had grade 
      3-4 toxicities including thrombocytopenia (6%), fatigue (3%), and dizziness (3%). 
      No patients achieved complete or partial responses and the median 
      progression-free survival was 1.4 months (95% confidence interval, 0.8 to 2.8). 
      CONCLUSION: OPB-111077 was well tolerated in patients with advanced HCC after 
      sorafenib failure, but only showed limited preliminary efficacy outcomes. Further 
      investigation of the role of the STAT3 signaling pathway in HCC and the 
      development of biomarkers for STAT3 inhibitors are warranted.

TI  - BAY 43-9006: early clinical data in patients with advanced solid malignancies.
PG  - 2249-53
AB  - Various signalling pathways can confer the malignant phenotype to a cell. Ras 
      signalling proteins have been found to play an important role in controlling 
      cellular growth. Raf-1 is a protein kinase that exerts its effects downstream of 
      Ras in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and is thus likely to be 
      crucial in the development of the malignant phenotype. BAY 43-9006 is an orally 
      administered selective inhibitor of Raf-1 and the first compound of its class to 
      enter clinical trials. This article describes the early clinical data of BAY 
      43-9006 in patients with advanced, refractory solid tumours. To date, over 60 
      patients have been treated as part of four Phase I clinical trials. Dose levels 
      have ranged from 50mg once weekly to 200mg twice-daily in continuous 
      administration. The drug has been generally well tolerated with no dose limiting 
      toxicity yet encountered. The more common toxicities have involved the 
      gastrointestinal tract (diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramping) and the skin 
      (pruritus, rash, cheilitis). Pharmacokinetic evaluations have found BAY 43-9006 
      to have considerable interpatient variability. However, there seems to be an 
      increase in C(max) and AUC values with increasing dose. There is no clear effect 
      of food on bioavailability. Splitting the dose to twice-daily administration has 
      shown increases in C(max) and AUC values but is also accompanied by considerable 
      interpatient variability.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Factors Contribute to Synergism between 
      Let-7c-5p and 5-Fluorouracil in Inhibiting Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell 
      Viability.
PG  - 1257-1263
LID - 10.1124/dmd.120.000207 [doi]
AB  - Pharmacological interventions for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are hindered by 
      complex factors, and rational combination therapy may be developed to improve 
      therapeutic outcomes. Very recently, we have identified a bioengineered microRNA 
      let-7c-5p (or let-7c) agent as an effective inhibitor against HCC in vitro and in 
      vivo. In this study, we sought to identify small-molecule drugs that may 
      synergistically act with let-7c against HCC. Interestingly, we found that let-7c 
      exhibited a strong synergism with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the inhibition of HCC 
      cell viability as manifested by average combination indices of 0.3 and 0.5 in 
      Hep3B and Huh7 cells, respectively. By contrast, coadministration of let-7c with 
      doxorubicin or sorafenib inhibited HCC cell viability with, rather surprisingly, 
      no or minimal synergy. Further studies showed that protein levels of multidrug 
      resistance-associated protein (MRP) ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 5 
      (MRP5/ABCC5), a 5-FU efflux transporter, were reduced around 50% by let-7c in HCC 
      cells. This led to a greater degree of intracellular accumulation of 5-FU in Huh7 
      cells as well as the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate, an 
      endogenous substrate of MRP5. Since 5-FU is an irreversible inhibitor of 
      thymidylate synthetase (TS), we investigated the interactions of let-7c with 5-FU 
      at pharmacodynamic level. Interestingly, our data revealed that let-7c 
      significantly reduced TS protein levels in Huh7 cells, which was associated with 
      the suppression of upstream transcriptional factors as well as other regulatory 
      factors. Collectively, these results indicate that let-7c interacts with 5-FU at 
      both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic levels, and these findings shall offer 
      insight into molecular mechanisms of synergistic drug combinations. SIGNIFICANCE 
      STATEMENT: Combination therapy is a common strategy that generally involves 
      pharmacodynamic interactions. After identifying a strong synergism between 
      let-7c-5p and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) against hepatocellular carcinoma cell 
      viability, we reveal the involvement of both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      mechanisms. In particular, let-7c enhances 5-FU exposure (via suppressing 
      ABCC5/MRP5 expression) and cotargets thymidylate synthase with 5-FU (let-7c 
      reduces protein expression, whereas 5-FU irreversibly inactivates enzyme). These 
      findings provide insight into developing rational combination therapies based on 
      pharmacological mechanisms.

TI  - Enhanced antitumour effect for hepatocellular carcinoma in the advanced stage 
      using a cyclodextrin-sorafenib-chaperoned inclusion complex.
PG  - 4758-4768
LID - 10.1039/c9bm01190k [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a hypervascular tumour characterized by 
      tumour-driven neovascularization. The degrees of blood oxygen saturation (DBOS), 
      microvessel density (MVD) and tumour size (TS) are indicators in identifying the 
      development stage of HCC. Herein, we proposed an HCC staging model using HepG2 
      tumour-bearing mice based on DBOS, MVD and TS. According to the patterns of these 
      three criteria, HCC was classified into four stages: early, intermediate, 
      advanced and end stages. The advanced stage was characterized by MVD of 50-90 
      (number per mm(2)), DBOS of 12-16% and TS of 250-600 mm(3), which poses a 
      critical challenge in HCC therapy. In order to efficiently control and treat HCC 
      in the advanced stage, we developed a cyclodextrin (CD)-based chaperoned 
      inclusion complex using Sorafenib (Sor), β-CD and γ-CD (SCD) via the 
      co-crystallization method. The structural study manifested that CDs could 
      encapsulate Sor with the hydrophobic cavities at a 1 : 1 stoichiometry ratio. The 
      crystallographic analysis indicated that Sor-β-CD presented a diagonal stacking 
      pattern, while Sor-γ-CD possessed a channel-type structure. The resultant 
      chaperoned inclusion complexes significantly improved the solubility, dissolution 
      rate and drug release of Sor, leading to superior pharmacokinetics, 
      biodistribution and biosafety through oral administration. The antitumour effect 
      was then evaluated on a mouse model with advanced HCC through oral administration 
      and intratumour injection. The treatment involving the oral administration of 
      SCDs showed a promising therapeutic effect on advanced HCC, which efficiently 
      blocked angiogenesis and inhibited tumour progression. For the treatments using 
      intratumour injections, only Sor-γ-CD exhibited a satisfactory anti-tumour effect 
      with reduction in TS, MVD and DBOS. The enhanced therapeutic performance of 
      Sor-γ-CD was attributed to its channel-type structure, which had an impact on the 
      dissociation and release of the drug. Thus, Sor-γ-CD can be used as a potential 
      pro-drug for clinical medicine and basic research to treat HCC.

AB  - Sorafenib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of 
      advanced renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. By using a population 
      approach, this study aimed to characterise its pharmacokinetics. Plasma 
      concentration-time data (n = 372) from 71 patients under sorafenib were analysed 
      using nonlinear mixed-effect modelling to estimate population pharmacokinetic 
      parameters, as well as relationships between these parameters and different 
      covariates (demographic, biological). Simulations were done to compare different 
      daily dosing regimens in a context of dose-escalation. A 1-compartment model with 
      saturated absorption, first-order intestinal loss and elimination best described 
      the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib. Absolute bioavailability significantly dropped 
      with increasing daily doses of sorafenib. AUC increased less than proportionally 
      with increasing doses [47.3 (41.3-63.3), 60.3 (56.3-64.4), 71.4 (51.3-99.1), 75.9 
      (45.5-100.9) mg/L.h for 400, 800, 1,200 and 1,600 mg/day, respectively]. 
      According to the simulations, dividing the daily dose in three or four doses for 
      daily dose >800 mg would significantly increase AUC compared with a twice daily 
      dosing regimen (101.7 vs 81.6 mg/L.h for 400 mg q8h and 600 mg q12h respectively; 
      131.6 vs 91.5 mg/L.h for 400 mg q6h and 800 mg q12h, respectively). Thrice daily 
      regimen may be most suitable in a context of dose-escalation (>800 mg/day) in 
      non-responders to standard-dosing regimen.

TI  - Safety of raltegravir-based antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected patients

PG  - 247-249
LID - 10.1007/s10637-016-0405-0 [doi]
AB  - Background The risk of pharmacokinetic interaction is important in HIV-infected 
      cancer patients receiving concomitantly highly active antiretroviral therapy 
      (HAART) and anti-cancer systemic treatments. We aimed to evaluate the safety 
      profile of raltegravir-based HAART in cancer patients receiving multi-kinase 
      inhibitors (MKIs). Patients and Methods We conducted a retrospective medical 
      record review of adult, HIV-infected cancer patients treated in our institutions 
      from January 2010 to December 2015. Patients eligible for the present analysis 
      were those receiving a raltegravir-based HAART at the time of the initiation of a 
      MKI for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. Treatment-related toxicity, 
      virological outcomes and pharmacokinetic profile of MKIs were examined. Results 
      Twelve patients (7 males, median age 55 years) were identified. Seven had 
      sarcoma/GIST, 3 had hepatocellular carcinoma, one had pancreatic neuroendocrine 
      tumor, and one had NSCLC. Patients received the following MKIs: imatinib (n = 3), 
      sorafenib (n = 3), pazopanib (n = 3), sunitinib (n = 2) and erlotinib (n = 1). 
      The mean CD4+ count at baseline was 929 cells/mm(3), and 860 cells/mm(3) after 
      completion of MKI treatment. In all patients, HIV viral loads remained below the 
      limit of detection (40 copies/ mm(3)) during the whole MKI treatment. No 
      virological failure occurred. No unexpected or serious adverse event related 
      either to raltegravir-based HAART or to MKIs was observed. The trough plasma 
      concentrations of MKIs were assessed in 8 patients, and were found normal in all 
      but one case (not related to raltegravir-based HAART). Conclusions The present 
      data represent the first documentation of the concomitant use of 
      raltegravir-containing HAART and MKIs in HIV-infected adult patients with 
      advanced non-AIDS defining malignancies, with a reassuring safety profile.

TI  - Inhibition of Hepatic CYP2D6 by the Active N-Oxide Metabolite of Sorafenib.
PG  - 107
LID - 10.1208/s12248-019-0374-2 [doi]
AB  - The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib (SOR) is used to treat patients with 
      hepatocellular and renal carcinomas. SOR undergoes CYP-mediated biotransformation 
      to a pharmacologically active N-oxide metabolite (SNO) that has been shown to 
      accumulate to varying extents in individuals. Kinase inhibitors like SOR are 
      frequently coadministered with a range of other drugs to improve the efficacy of 
      anticancer drug therapy and to treat comorbidities. Recent evidence has suggested 
      that SNO is more effective than SOR as an inhibitor of CYP3A4-mediated midazolam 
      1'-hydroxylation. CYP2D6 is also reportedly inhibited by SOR. The present study 
      assessed the possibility that SNO might contribute to CYP2D6 inhibition. The 
      inhibition kinetics of CYP2D6-mediated dextromethorphan O-demethylation were 
      analyzed in human hepatic microsomes, with SNO found to be ~ 19-fold more active 
      than SOR (K(i)s 1.8 ± 0.3 μM and 34 ± 11 μM, respectively). Molecular docking 
      studies of SOR and SNO were undertaken using multiple crystal structures of 
      CYP2D6. Both molecules mediated interactions with key amino acid residues in 
      putative substrate recognition sites of CYP2D6. However, a larger number of 
      H-bonding interactions was noted between the N-oxide moiety of SNO and active 
      site residues that account for its greater inhibition potency. These findings 
      suggest that SNO has the potential to contribute to pharmacokinetic interactions 
      involving SOR, perhaps in those individuals in whom SNO accumulates.

PG  - e2100201

AB  - In the designed compounds, a new linker was inserted in the form of fragments 
      with verified VEGFR-2 inhibitory potential, including an α,β-unsaturated ketonic 
      fragment, pyrazole, and pyrimidine. Also, new distal hydrophobic moieties were 
      attached to these linkers that are expected to increase the hydrophobic 
      interaction with VEGFR-2 and, consequently, the affinity. These structural 
      optimizations have led us to identify the novel dihydropyrazole derivative 6(e) 
      as a promising hit molecule. All the new derivatives were evaluated to assess 
      their anticancer activity against three human cancer cell lines, including HepG2, 
      HCT-116, and MCF-7. The results of the in vitro anticancer evaluation study 
      revealed the moderate to excellent cytotoxicity of 6(c) , 6(e) , 6(g) , and 7(b) 
      , with IC(50) values in the low micromolar range. The inhibitory activity of 
      VEGFR-2 was investigated for 16 of the designed compounds. The enzyme assay 
      results of the new compounds were compared with those of sorafenib as a reference 
      VEGFR-2 inhibitor. The obtained results demonstrated that our derivatives are 
      potent VEGFR-2 inhibitors. The most potent derivatives 6(c) , 6(e) , 6(g) , and 
      7(b) showed IC(50) values in the range of 0.11-0.22 µM. Molecular docking and 
      pharmacokinetic studies were also conducted to rationalize the VEGFR-2 inhibitory 
      activity and to evaluate the ability of the most potent derivatives to be 
      developed as good drug candidates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Trebananib, an investigational peptibody, binds to angiopoietin 1 and 
      2, thereby blocking their interaction with Tie2. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This 
      open-label phase I study examined trebananib 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg intravenous 
      (I.V.) once weekly plus sorafenib 400 mg twice per day or sunitinib 50 mg once 
      per day in advanced RCC. Primary end points were adverse event incidence and 
      pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were enrolled. During trebananib 
      plus sorafenib administration (n = 17), the most common treatment-related adverse 
      events (TRAEs) included rash (n = 12; 71%), diarrhea (n = 12; 71%), hypertension 
      (n = 11; 65%), and fatigue (n = 11; 65%); grade ≥ 3 TRAEs (n = 7; 41%); and 2 
      patients (12%) had peripheral edema. During trebananib plus sunitinib 
      administration (n = 19), the most common TRAEs included diarrhea (n = 14; 74%), 
      fatigue (n = 13; 68%), hypertension (n = 11; 58%), and decreased appetite (n = 
      11; 58%); grade ≥ 3 TRAEs (n = 13; 68%); and 8 (42%) patients had peripheral 
      edema. Trebananib did not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib or 
      sunitinib. No patient developed anti-trebananib antibodies. Objective response 
      rates were 29% (trebananib plus sorafenib) and 53% (trebananib plus sunitinib). 
      CONCLUSION: The toxicities of trebananib 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg I.V. plus sorafenib 
      or sunitinib in RCC were similar to those of sorafenib or sunitinib monotherapy, 
      with peripheral edema being likely specific to the combinations. Antitumor 
      activity was observed.

AB  - The association of deregulated signal pathways with various diseases has long 
      been a research hotspot. One of the most important signal pathways, the MAPK 
      (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signal pathway, plays a vital role in 
      transducing extracellular signals into vital intracellular mechanisms. While 
      mutations on its key component Raf kinase lead to sever diseases, targeted 
      inhibition has thereby become an attractive therapeutic strategy. Several drugs 
      have been approved for the treatment of Raf relevant diseases, yet more 
      candidates are ever needed as the known drugs have confronted resistance and side 
      effects. In the present study, we primarily investigated the binding modes of 
      type I/II and type II inhibitors with B-Raf kinase. Based on the current 
      knowledge, these ligands were fragmented and recombined to provide new 
      interesting insights. Afterwards, a series of derivatives has been synthesized 
      after the validation of hit compound. In addition, in vitro assays were carried 
      out to profile the pharmacological properties of all the entities. Of all the 
      compounds, compound 5h showed the best profile and may be used in the future 
      study.

TI  - A preclinical evaluation of a novel multikinase inhibitor, SKLB-329, as a 
      therapeutic agent against hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 2972-83
LID - 10.1002/ijc.28944 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a serious life-threatening malignant disease of 
      liver. Molecular targeted therapies are considered a promising strategy for the 
      treatment of HCC. Sorafenib is the first, and so far the only targeted drug 
      approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical therapy of 
      HCC. Despite being effective in some HCC patients, some demerits of sorafenib in 
      the treatment of HCC, such as modest survival benefits, and drug resistance, have 
      also been reported, which highlights the unmet medical need among patients with 
      HCC. Here, we report a novel multikinase inhibitor discovered by us, SKLB-329, 
      which potently inhibits angiogenesis-related kinases including VEGFR1/2/3, and 
      FGFR2, and the Src kinase. SKLB-329 significantly inhibited endothelial cell 
      growth, migration, invasion and tube formation. It showed potent anti-angiogenic 
      activity in a transgenic zebrafish model. Moreover, SKLB-329 could efficiently 
      restrain the proliferation of HCC cells through down-regulation of Src-mediated 
      FAK and Stat3 activity. In vivo, oral administration of SKLB-329 considerably 
      suppressed the tumor growth in HCC xenograft models (HepG2 and SMMC7721) in a 
      dose-dependent manner. In all of the in vitro and in vivo assays of this 
      investigation, sorafenib was used as a positive control, and in most assays 
      SKLB-329 exhibited a higher potency compared with the positive control. In 
      addition, SKLB-329 also bears favorable pharmacokinetic properties. Collectively, 
      the results of preclinical studies presented here demonstrate that SKLB-329 is a 
      promising drug candidate for HCC treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib has proven survival benefits in patients with advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The viability of continuing sorafenib at a higher 
      dosage in patients who experienced radiologic disease progression was 
      investigated. METHODS: Patients who experienced disease progression while on 
      sorafenib 400 mg twice daily were randomized to sorafenib 600 mg twice daily (n = 
      49) or best supportive care (n = 52). The primary end point was progression-free 
      survival (PFS). Time to progression, overall survival, and safety were also 
      evaluated. RESULTS: The study did not meet its primary end point. The difference 
      in PFS between the sorafenib arm (3.91 months) and the best supportive care arm 
      (2.69 months) did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.086). Adverse events 
      were mainly grade 1-2 and similar across both groups. In the sorafenib arm, the 
      most frequent events were diarrhea (80%), weight loss (75%), fatigue (67%), 
      hand-foot-skin reaction (49%), abdominal pain (37%), and stomatitis (26%). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Escalated-dose sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC who 
      progressed while on sorafenib, failed to provide any clinical benefit. 
      Second-line treatment still remains an open issue to be explored in appropriate 
      clinical trials.

TI  - Inhibition of OATP1B1 by tyrosine kinase inhibitors: in vitro-in vivo 
      correlations.
PG  - 894-8
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2013.811 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can decrease docetaxel 
      clearance in patients by an unknown mechanism. We hypothesised that these 
      interactions are mediated by the hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1. METHODS: The 
      influence of 16 approved TKIs on transport was studied in vitro using HEK293 
      cells expressing OATP1B1 or its mouse equivalent Oatp1b2. Pharmacokinetic studies 
      were performed with Oatp1b2-knockout and OATP1B1-transgenic mice. RESULTS: All 
      docetaxel-interacting TKIs, including sorafenib, were identified as potent 
      inhibitors of OATP1B1 in vitro. Although Oatp1b2 deficiency in vivo was 
      associated with increased docetaxel exposure, single- or multiple-dose sorafenib 
      did not influence docetaxel pharmacokinetics. CONCLUSION: These findings 
      highlight the importance of identifying proper preclinical models for verifying 
      and predicting TKI-chemotherapy interactions involving transporters.

TI  - Sorafenib in thyroid cancer patients: learning from toxicity.
PG  - e3
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2014-0156 [doi]
AB  - A recent review showed frequent reductions of sorafenib dose in the treatment of 
      metastatic thyroid cancer because of toxicity consistent with the findings of the 
      phase III DECISION trial and contrasting with the safety of sorafenib in other 
      cancer populations. The unexpected excess of toxicity observed in thyroid cancer 
      patients may be linked to a high prevalence of sarcopenia in this population, 
      resulting in frequent overexposure to sorafenib.

TI  - pH-sensitive nanoformulated triptolide as a targeted therapeutic strategy for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 8027-39
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has one of the worst prognoses for survival as it 
      is poorly responsive to both conventional chemotherapy and mechanism-directed 
      therapy. This results from a lack of therapeutic concentration in the tumor 
      tissue coupled with the highly toxic off-site effects exhibited by these 
      compounds. Consequently, we believe the best packaging for holistic therapy for 
      HCC will involve three components: a potent therapeutic, a rationally designed 
      drug delivery vehicle to enrich the target site concentration of the drug, and a 
      surface ligand that can enable a greater propensity to internalization by tumor 
      cells compared to the parenchyma. We screened a library containing hundreds of 
      compounds against a panel of HCC cells and found the natural product, triptolide, 
      to be more effective than sorafenib, doxorubicin, and daunorubicin, which are the 
      current standards of therapy. However, the potential clinical application of 
      triptolide is limited due to its poor solubility and high toxicity. Consequently, 
      we synthesized tumor pH-sensitive nanoformulated triptolide coated with folate 
      for use in an HCC-subpopulation that overexpresses the folate receptor. Our 
      results show triptolide itself can prevent disease progression, but at the cost 
      of significant toxicity. Conversely, our pH-sensitive nanoformulated triptolide 
      facilitates uptake into the tumor, and specifically tumor cells, leading to a 
      further increase in efficacy while mitigating systemic toxicity.

TI  - CEP-32496: a novel orally active BRAF(V600E) inhibitor with selective cellular 
      and in vivo antitumor activity.
PG  - 930-41
LID - 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0645 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the BRAF gene have been identified in approximately 7% of cancers, 
      including 60% to 70% of melanomas, 29% to 83% of papillary thyroid carcinomas, 4% 
      to 16% colorectal cancers, and a lesser extent in serous ovarian and non-small 
      cell lung cancers. The V600E mutation is found in the vast majority of cases and 
      is an activating mutation, conferring transforming and immortalization potential 
      to cells. CEP-32496 is a potent BRAF inhibitor in an in vitro binding assay for 
      mutated BRAF(V600E) (K(d) BRAF(V600E) = 14 nmol/L) and in a mitogen-activated 
      protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated (ER) kinase (MEK) phosphorylation 
      (pMEK) inhibition assay in human melanoma (A375) and colorectal cancer (Colo-205) 
      cell lines (IC(50) = 78 and 60 nmol/L). In vitro, CEP-32496 has multikinase 
      binding activity at other cancer targets of interest; however, it exhibits 
      selective cellular cytotoxicity for BRAF(V600E) versus wild-type cells. CEP-32496 
      is orally bioavailable in multiple preclinical species (>95% in rats, dogs, and 
      monkeys) and has single oral dose pharmacodynamic inhibition (10-55 mg/kg) of 
      both pMEK and pERK in BRAF(V600E) colon carcinoma xenografts in nude mice. 
      Sustained tumor stasis and regressions are observed with oral administration 
      (30-100 mg/kg twice daily) against BRAF(V600E) melanoma and colon carcinoma 
      xenografts, with no adverse effects. Little or no epithelial hyperplasia was 
      observed in rodents and primates with prolonged oral administration and sustained 
      exposure. CEP-32496 benchmarks favorably with respect to other kinase inhibitors, 
      including RAF-265 (phase I), sorafenib, (approved), and vemurafenib 
      (PLX4032/RG7204, approved). CEP-32496 represents a novel and pharmacologically 
      active BRAF inhibitor with a favorable side effect profile currently in clinical 
      development.

LID - 10.1080/14756366.2021.1956488 [doi]
AB  - Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) plays a critical role in 
      cancer angiogenesis. Inhibition of VEGFR-2 activity proved effective suppression 
      of tumour propagation. Accordingly, two series of new 3-methylquinoxaline 
      derivatives have been designed and synthesised as VEGFR-2 inhibitors. The 
      synthesised derivatives were evaluated in vitro for their cytotoxic activities 
      against MCF-7and HepG2 cell lines. In addition, the VEGFR-2 inhibitory activities 
      of the target compounds were estimated to indicate the potential mechanism of 
      their cytotoxicity. To a great extent, the results of VEGFR-2 inhibition were 
      highly correlated with that of cytotoxicity. Compound 27a was the most potent 
      VEGFR-2 inhibitor with IC(50) of 3.2 nM very close to positive control sorafenib 
      (IC(50) = 3.12 nM). Such compound exhibited a strong cytotoxic effect against 
      MCF-7 and HepG2, respectively with IC(50) of 7.7 and 4.5 µM in comparison to 
      sorafenib (IC(50) = 3.51 and 2.17 µM). In addition, compounds 28, 30f, 30i, and 
      31b exhibited excellent VEGFR-2 inhibition activities (IC(50) range from 4.2 to 
      6.1 nM) with promising cytotoxic activity. Cell cycle progression and apoptosis 
      induction were investigated for the most active member 27a. Also, the effect of 
      27a on the level of caspase-3, caspase-9, and BAX/Bcl-2 ratio was determined. 
      Molecular docking studies were implemented to interpret the binding mode of the 
      target compounds with the VEGFR-2 pocket. Furthermore, toxicity and ADMET 
      calculations were performed for the synthesised compounds to study their 
      pharmacokinetic profiles.

TI  - Phase I trial of preoperative chemoradiation plus sorafenib for high-risk 
      extremity soft tissue sarcomas with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI correlates.
PG  - 6902-11
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1594 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We conducted a phase I trial of the addition of sorafenib to a 
      chemoradiotherapy regimen in patients with high-risk (intermediate/high grade, >5 
      cm) extremity soft tissue sarcoma undergoing limb salvage surgery. We conducted a 
      correlative study of quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) to 
      assess response to treatment. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients were treated at 
      increasing dose levels of sorafenib (200 mg daily, 400 mg daily, 400 mg twice 
      daily) initiated 14 days before three preoperative and three postoperative cycles 
      of epirubicin/ifosfamide. Radiation (28 Gy) was administered during cycle 2 with 
      epirubicin omitted. The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated 
      dose (MTD) of sorafenib. DCE-MRI was conducted at baseline, after 2 weeks of 
      sorafenib, and before surgery. The imaging data were subjected to quantitative 
      pharmacokinetic analyses. RESULTS: Eighteen subjects were enrolled, of which 16 
      were evaluable. The MTD of sorafenib was 400 mg daily. Common grade 3-4 adverse 
      events included neutropenia (94%), hypophosphatemia (75%), anemia (69%), 
      thrombocytopenia (50%), and neutropenic fever/infection (50%). Of note, 38% 
      developed wound complications requiring surgical intervention. The rate of ≥95% 
      histopathologic tumor necrosis was 44%. Changes in DCE-MRI biomarker ΔK(trans) 
      after 2 weeks of sorafenib correlated with histologic response (R(2) = 0.67, P = 
      0.012) at surgery. CONCLUSION: The addition of sorafenib to preoperative 
      chemoradiotherapy is feasible and warrants further investigation in a larger 
      trial. DCE-MRI detected changes in tumor perfusion after 2 weeks of sorafenib and 
      may be a minimally invasive tool for rapid assessment of drug effect in soft 
      tissue sarcoma.

TI  - Pharmacodynamic monitoring of molecular-targeted agents in the peripheral blood 
      of leukemia patients using flow cytometry.
PG  - 133-9
LID - 10.1177/0192623307310952 [doi]
AB  - The introduction of specific, molecular-targeted drugs is radically changing 
      cancer treatment. Pharmacodynamics, which measures drug effects on the host, is 
      key during early-phase clinical trials of novel agents to determine the relations 
      between drug dose and target inhibition as well as measure the downstream effects 
      of target inhibition on the cancer. In this article, we describe the application 
      of flow cytometry to the pharmacodynamic monitoring of molecular-targeted agents 
      in leukemia patients. The methods are based on current clinical flow-cytometry 
      applications, with the addition of phosphospecific antibodies to measure the 
      activation states of intracellular signaling elements and the introduction of 
      techniques that maintain drug-target equilibrium during sample preparation. Using 
      this approach, we successfully showed dose-dependent inhibition of c-Kit during a 
      phase I clinical trial treating acute leukemia patients with the novel agent 
      sorafenib. Further refinements identify considerable interpatient variation in 
      signaling activity within leukemic blast populations, suggesting that an 
      individualized approach to treatment based on flow cytometric monitoring might be 
      advantageous. Improvements in sample turnaround offer the potential to introduce 
      real-time pharmacodynamic monitoring during early-phase clinical trials.

TI  - Combined chemo/photothermal therapy based on mesoporous silica-Au core-shell 
      nanoparticles for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.
PG  - 1487-1495
LID - 10.1080/03639045.2019.1629688 [doi]
AB  - Chemotherapy has been widely used for treatment to malignant cancer, such as 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Chemotherapeutic effect was not often efficient 
      to achieve totally tumor ablation due to the poor cellular uptake and drug 
      resistance. To address these problems, a novel nanoplatform was constructed based 
      on nontoxic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) for a combined 
      chemo/photothermal therapy to enhance tumor cell accumulation and promote 
      toxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs. Prepared MSNs were consisted of Au nanoshell 
      for photothermal conversion and a first-line anti-HCC drug-sorafenib (SO) for 
      chemotherapy. The SO-Au-MSNs could help SO accumulate more in hepatic cancer 
      cells. Under near infrared irradiation, SO-Au-MSNs exerted a high cell inhibition 
      rate which could be attributed to the enhanced toxicity of SO under hyperthermia 
      and synergistic chemo/photothermal therapy. SO-Au-MSNs showed a good 
      compatibility as well as efficient cell cytotoxicity. Overall, SO-Au-MSNs would 
      be a promising candidate for further enhancing the antitumor effect on HCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with severe renal impairment or undergoing hemodialysis are 
      usually excluded from clinical trials. Available data regarding safety and 
      activity of systemic therapies (ST) in hemodialyzed patients are scarce. METHODS: 
      Clinical data were searched through PubMed database until April 2020 according to 
      PRISMA criteria. Efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment of ST were 
      reported. RESULTS: Among 270 references, 56 reports were evaluated in full text: 
      41 were included for efficacy and 42 for safety analysis (sunitinib n = 68, 
      bevacizumab n = 6, everolimus n = 28, temsirolimus n = 17, sorafenib n = 55, 
      axitinib n = 13, pazopanib n = 13, nivolumab n = 18, cabozantinib n = 0, 
      lenvatinib n = 0, and ipilimumab n = 0). Twelve of the reports included PK 
      assessment among dialyzed patients. Hemodialysis did not seem to modify the 
      expected efficacy and safety of each compound among patients undergoing 
      hemodialysis. PK assessments were not modified in comparison with a population 
      not undergoing dialysis. CONCLUSION: Targeted and Immune therapies seem to be 
      effective and can be used among patients undergoing hemodialysis. Due to frailty 
      and comorbidities associated to chronic hemodialysis enhanced vigilance for these 
      therapies within this specific population is recommended. Dedicated prospective 
      clinical trials would definitely help to obtain data with a higher level of 
      evidence.

TI  - Specifically targeting angiopoietin-2 inhibits angiogenesis, Tie2-expressing 
      monocyte infiltration, and tumor growth.
PG  - 1001-11
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2317 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) plays a key role in maintaining stable 
      vasculature, whereas in a tumor Ang2 antagonizes Ang1's function and promotes the 
      initiation of the angiogenic switch. Specifically targeting Ang2 is a promising 
      anticancer strategy. Here we describe the development and characterization of a 
      new class of biotherapeutics referred to as CovX-Bodies, which are created by 
      chemical fusion of a peptide and a carrier antibody scaffold. EXPERIMENTAL 
      DESIGN: Various linker tethering sites on peptides were examined for their effect 
      on CovX-Body in vitro potency and pharmacokinetics. Ang2 CovX-Bodies with low 
      nmol/L IC(50)s and significantly improved pharmacokinetics were tested in tumor 
      xenograft studies alone or in combination with standard of care agents. Tumor 
      samples were analyzed for target engagement, via Ang2 protein level, 
      CD31-positive tumor vasculature, and Tie2 expressing monocyte penetration. 
      RESULTS: Bivalent Ang2 CovX-Bodies selectively block the Ang2-Tie2 interaction 
      (IC(50) < 1 nmol/L) with dramatically improved pharmacokinetics (T(½) > 100 
      hours). Using a staged Colo-205 xenograft model, significant tumor growth 
      inhibition (TGI) was observed (40%-63%, P < 0.01). Ang2 protein levels were 
      reduced by approximately 50% inside tumors (P < 0.01), whereas tumor microvessel 
      density (P < 0.01) and intratumor proangiogenic Tie2(+)CD11b(+) cells (P < 0.05) 
      were significantly reduced. When combined with sunitinib, sorafenib, bevacizumab, 
      irinotecan, or docetaxel, Ang2 CovX-Bodies produced even greater efficacy (∼80% 
      TGI, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: CovX-Bodies provide an elegant solution to overcome 
      the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic problems of peptides. Long-acting Ang2 
      specific CovX-Bodies will be useful as single agents and in combination with 
      standard-of-care agents.

TI  - Tolerable sorafenib therapy for a renal cell carcinoma patient with hemodialysis: 
      a case study.
PG  - 512-4
LID - 10.1007/s10147-010-0070-9 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib (Nexavar(®)) has been approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell 
      carcinoma (RCC) and hepatocellular carcinoma. There is little information on the 
      dosage adjustment of sorafenib for patients with end-stage renal failure. Herein, 
      we have examined the effect of hemodialysis on the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib 
      and its major active metabolite, M-2, and assessed sorafenib-related toxicity 
      throughout the therapy. The patient was a 54-year-old man who was diagnosed with 
      advanced RCC. Pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out on days 9 and 183. The 
      patient had stable disease on day 77 and showed progression on day 181. He has 
      received about 6 months of continuous treatment with sorafenib 800 mg/day without 
      any clinically relevant toxicity. The pharmacokinetic parameters of sorafenib 
      such as C (max) and AUC(0-12) on day 183 were in the range of the reference 
      values reported in patients with normal renal function. Our results suggest that 
      sorafenib administered at a dose of 400 mg twice per day was well tolerated, at 
      least for 6 months, for a patient undergoing hemodialysis.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer in the world with 
      increasing incidence. Chemotherapy is required for HCC patients after receiving 
      surgical resection. Serious off-target induced side effects and systemic toxicity 
      limit the clinical utility of drugs. Targeting therapeutic nanomedicine is an 
      innovative strategy for enhancing drug delivery efficiency and reducing side 
      effects. Here, we successfully formulated nanocarriers to encapsulate sorafenib, 
      an FDA approved drug for treatment of HCC. Sorafenib is encapsulated with an 
      entrapment efficiency >80% over 20 days. The effective aqueous solubility is 
      improved over 1900-fold. The release ratio in vitro is characterized by a 
      half-life of T(1/2) = 22.7 h. The peak target-to-background ratio for nanocarrier 
      uptake by tumor occurs at 24 h post-injection, and is significantly greater for 
      the target peptide versus controls. Ex vivo biodistribution confirms the in vivo 
      results. Tumor regression is significantly greater for the target peptide versus 
      controls after 21 days of therapy. No acute toxicity is found by blood chemistry 
      or necropsy. In summary, a peptide specific for GPC3 has been identified, and 
      used to modify the surface of a nanocarrier that encapsulates sorafenib with high 
      entrapment efficiency. Regression of HCC xenograft tumors showed promise for 
      targeted drug delivery.

AB  - A novel and intelligent pH-controlled system having an "on-off" switch based on 
      poly(l-histidine) (PLH) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) coated mesoporous silica 
      nanoparticles (MSNs) (MSNs-PLH-PEG) was designed and evaluated for tumor specific 
      drug release. The unsaturated nitrogen-rich polymer, PLH, which can change its 
      solubility at different pH values, was employed for establishing the reversible 
      "on-off" switch. In vitro drug release results demonstrated that MSNs-PLH-PEG has 
      a pH-controlled "on-off" profile with the change of pH value between pH 7.4 and 
      5.0. Furthermore, in vitro cellular uptake study results showed that the 
      entrapped drug could be efficiently released from MSNs-PLH-PEG under acidic 
      endosome/lysosome. In vitro cell cytotoxicity and in vivo antitumor studies 
      results indicated that sorafenib loaded MSNs-PLH-PEG exhibited good 
      anti-proliferation and tumor growth inhibition effects. Haemolysis assay and 
      histological analysis of MSNs-PLH-PEG showed negligible haemolysis activity and 
      no visible tissue toxicity at the test dose. This study represents a promising 
      and intelligent pH-controlled intelligent system for drug delivery and controlled 
      release. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: A novel pH-controlled intelligent and 
      reversible "on-off" switch system based on poly(l-histidine) and poly(ethylene 
      glycol) coated mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs-PLH-PEG) by "graft to" 
      synthesis method was constructed for tumor specific drug release. The unsaturated 
      nitrogen-rich pH-sensitive polymer, PLH, which can change its solubility in 
      different pH values, was employed as the reversible "on-off" switch in MSNs for 
      the first time. The pH-controlled "on-off" switch manner was observed in the drug 
      release results in vitro. In the in vivo antitumor studies, sorafenib loaded 
      MSNs-PLH-PEG could effectively suppressed tumor growth in H22 tumor bearing mice. 
      It is expected that the pH-controlled intelligent "on-off" switch system we 
      designed holds remarkable promise and provides valuable strategy for possible 
      applications in cancer therapy.

TI  - Simultaneous analysis of oral anticancer drugs for renal cell carcinoma in human 
      plasma using liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization tandem mass 
      spectrometry.
PG  - e4184
LID - 10.1002/bmc.4184 [doi]
AB  - An analytical method using high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray 
      ionization tandem mass spectrometry has been developed and validated for 
      simultaneous measurement of four tyrosine kinase inhibitors used for renal cell 
      carcinoma and their metabolites in human plasma. Despite their similar 
      structures, it is difficult to measure plasma levels of these compounds 
      simultaneously using optimal MS parameters for each compound because a 
      quantitative range exceeding 50,000-fold is required. To overcome this problem, 
      we used a linear range shift technique using in-source collision-induced 
      dissociation. Linearity ranges of sorafenib, sorafenib N-oxide, sunitinib, 
      N-desethyl sunitinib, axitinib and pazopanib were 100-10,000, 10-1,000, 1-100, 
      1-100, 1-100 and 500-50,000 ng/mL, respectively. The intra- and inter-day 
      precision and accuracy were high, and coefficients of variation and relative 
      error were <10.3% and within ±11.8%, respectively. The matrix effects of all 
      analytes ranged from 87.7 to 114.8%. Extraction recoveries and overall recoveries 
      showed small extraction loss (<15.0%) for all analytes. Moreover, all cancer 
      patient samples used in this study were successfully quantified and fell within 
      the linear range of measurement. Therefore, this novel analytical system using 
      in-source collision-induced dissociation has sufficient performance to measure 
      plasma concentrations of these four tyrosine kinase inhibitors and their 
      metabolites for therapeutic drug monitoring.

TI  - AC220 is a uniquely potent and selective inhibitor of FLT3 for the treatment of 
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
PG  - 2984-92
LID - 10.1182/blood-2009-05-222034 [doi]
AB  - Activating mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 are present in up to 
      approximately 30% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, implicating FLT3 as a 
      driver of the disease and therefore as a target for therapy. We report the 
      characterization of AC220, a second-generation FLT3 inhibitor, and a comparison 
      of AC220 with the first-generation FLT3 inhibitors CEP-701, MLN-518, PKC-412, 
      sorafenib, and sunitinib. AC220 exhibits low nanomolar potency in biochemical and 
      cellular assays and exceptional kinase selectivity, and in animal models is 
      efficacious at doses as low as 1 mg/kg given orally once daily. The data reveal 
      that the combination of excellent potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic 
      properties is unique to AC220, which therefore is the first drug candidate with a 
      profile that matches the characteristics desirable for a clinical FLT3 inhibitor.

TI  - miR-27b synergizes with anticancer drugs via p53 activation and CYP1B1 
      suppression.
PG  - 477-95
LID - 10.1038/cr.2015.23 [doi]
AB  - Liver and kidney cancers are notorious for drug resistance. Due to the 
      complexity, redundancy and interpatient heterogeneity of resistance mechanisms, 
      most efforts targeting a single pathway were unsuccessful. Novel personalized 
      therapies targeting multiple essential drug resistance pathways in parallel hold 
      a promise for future cancer treatment. Exploiting the multitarget characteristic 
      of microRNAs (miRNAs), we developed a new therapeutic strategy by the 
      combinational use of miRNA and anticancer drugs to increase drug response. By a 
      systems approach, we identified that miR-27b, a miRNA deleted in liver and kidney 
      cancers, sensitizes cancer cells to a broad spectrum of anticancer drugs in vitro 
      and in vivo. Functionally, miR-27b enhances drug response by activating 
      p53-dependent apoptosis and reducing CYP1B1-mediated drug detoxification. 
      Notably, miR-27b promotes drug response specifically in patients carrying 
      p53-wild-type or CYP1B1-high signature. Together, we propose that miR-27b 
      synergizes with anticancer drugs in a defined subgroup of liver and kidney cancer 
      patients.

AB  - Bioresponsive cytosolic nanobased multidelivery has been emerging as an 
      enormously challenging novel concept due to the intrinsic protective barriers of 
      the cells and hardly controllable performances of nanomaterials. Here, we present 
      a new paradigm to advance nano-in-nano integration technology amenable to create 
      multifunctional nanovehicles showing considerable promise to overcome 
      restrictions of intracellular delivery, solve impediments of endosomal 
      localization and aid effectual tracking of nanoparticles. A redox responsive 
      intercalator chemistry comprised of cystine and 9-aminoacridine is designed as a 
      cross-linker to cap carboxylated porous silicon nanoparticles with DNA. These 
      intelligent nanocarriers are then encapsulated within novel one-pot 
      electrostatically complexed nano-networks made of a zwitterionic amino acid 
      (cysteine), an anionic bioadhesive polymer (poly(methyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic 
      acid)) and a cationic endosomolytic polymer (polyethyleneimine). This combined 
      nanocomposite is successfully tested for the co-delivery of hydrophobic 
      (sorafenib) or hydrophilic (calcein) molecules loaded within the porous core, and 
      an imaging agent covalently integrated into the polyplex shell by click 
      chemistry. High loading capacity, low cyto- and hemo-toxicity, glutathione 
      responsive on-command drug release, and superior cytosolic delivery are shown as 
      achievable key features of the proposed formulation. Overall, formulating drug 
      molecules, DNA and imaging agents, without any interference, in a 
      physico-chemically optimized carrier may open a path towards broad applicability 
      of these cost-effective multivalent nanocomposites for treating different 
      diseases.

TI  - Final analysis of a phase II trial using sorafenib for metastatic 
      castration-resistant prostate cancer.
PG  - 1636-40
LID - 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2008.08327.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if sorafenib is associated with an improved 4-month 
      probability of progression-free survival, using radiographic and clinical 
      criteria alone, in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. 
      Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetics, toxicity analysis and overall 
      survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was an open-label, phase II, two-stage 
      design, focusing on the results from the second stage, as criteria for 
      progression were modified after completing the first stage. Sorafenib was given 
      at a dose of 400 mg orally twice daily in 28-day cycles. Clinical and laboratory 
      assessments were done every 4 weeks, and radiographic scans were obtained every 8 
      weeks. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were accrued in the second stage; the median 
      (range) age was 66 (49-85) years, the on-study prostate-specific antigen level 
      was 68.45 (5.8-995) ng/mL, the Gleason score 8 (6-9) and Eastern Cooperative 
      Oncology Group status 1 (in 17 patients). Of the 24 patients, 21 had previous 
      chemotherapy with docetaxel. All patients had bony metastases, either alone (in 
      11) or with soft-tissue disease (in 13). One patient had a partial response; 10 
      patients had stable disease (median duration 18 weeks, range 15-48). At a median 
      potential follow-up of 27.2 months, the median progression-free survival was 3.7 
      months and the median overall survival was 18.0 months. For the whole trial of 46 
      patients the median survival was 18.3 months. Most frequent toxicities included 
      hand-foot skin reaction (grade 2 in nine patients, grade 3 in three), rash, 
      abnormalities in liver function tests, and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib has 
      moderate activity as a second-line treatment for metastatic castration-resistant 
      prostate cancer.

TI  - Phase I study of tivantinib in Japanese patients with advanced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma: Distinctive pharmacokinetic profiles from other solid tumors.
PG  - 611-7
LID - 10.1111/cas.12644 [doi]
AB  - A c-Met inhibitor tivantinib is a candidate anticancer agent for patients with 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and CYP2C19 is the key metabolic enzyme for 
      tivantinib. Previous Japanese phase I studies in patients with solid tumors 
      (except HCC) recommend 360 mg twice daily (BID) and 240 mg BID for CYP2C19 
      extensive metabolizers (EM) and poor metabolizers (PM), respectively. In this 
      study, Japanese patients with HCC in whom sorafenib treatment has failed were 
      enrolled to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of oral 
      tivantinib as a single agent. The dose was escalated separately in EM and PM, 
      from 120 mg BID to 240 mg BID, in both capsule and tablet formulations. A total 
      of 28 patients (EM: 21, PM: 7) received tivantinib. At a dose of 120 mg BID, 
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) did not develop in 12 EM (capsule: 6, tablet: 6) 
      and 7 PM (capsule: 4, tablet: 3) during the DLT-observation period (for 29 days 
      after first dosing). At this dose, the pharmacokinetic profiles of tivantinib 
      (AUC0-12 and Cmax ) did not remarkably differ between EM and PM. When treated 
      with 240 mg BID, 5 of 9 EM (capsule: 4 of 6, tablet: 1 of 3) developed 
      neutropenia-related DLT accompanying plasma tivantinib concentration higher than 
      expected from the previous studies. Consequently, PM did not receive 240 mg BID. 
      In conclusion, 120 mg BID of tivantinib is recommended among Japanese patients 
      with HCC regardless of CYP2C19 phenotype.

TI  - CF102 for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma: a phase I/II, open-label, 
      dose-escalation study.
PG  - 25-6
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2012-0211 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The A(3) adenosine receptor (A(3)AR) is overexpressed in the tumor 
      and in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). The orally active drug candidate CF102, an A(3)AR agonist, 
      induces apoptosis of HCC cells via deregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. In 
      this open label phase I/II trial, the safety and clinical effects of CF102 were 
      assessed in patients with advanced unresectable HCC. METHODS: The primary 
      objectives of this trial were to examine the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) 
      behavior of CF102 given orally (1, 5, and 25 mg BID) in 28-day cycles. Evaluation 
      of anti-tumor effects and the utilization of A(3)AR as a biological predictive 
      marker of response to CF102 were the secondary objectives. RESULTS: Eighteen 
      patients received CF102-six at each dose level. No serious drug-related adverse 
      events or dose-limiting toxicities were observed. CF102 demonstrated good oral 
      bioavailability and linear PK behavior. Median overall survival in the study 
      population, 67% of whom had received prior sorafenib, was 7.8 months, and for 
      Child Pugh B patients (28%) it was 8.1 months. Stable disease by RECIST was 
      observed in four patients for at least 4 months. CF102 maintained liver function 
      over a 6-month period. A correlation between receptor overexpression levels at 
      baseline and patients' overall survival was found. One of the patients who 
      presented with skin nodules that were biopsy-proven to be HCC metastases prior to 
      the trial showed complete metastasis regression during three months of treatment 
      with CF102. CONCLUSIONS: CF102 is safe and well-tolerated, showing favorable PK 
      characteristics in Child Pugh A and B HCC patients, justifying further clinical 
      development.

TI  - Phase I clinical and pharmacokinetic study of the Novel Raf kinase and vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor BAY 43-9006 in patients with 
      advanced refractory solid tumors.
PG  - 965-72
AB  - PURPOSE: BAY 43-9006 is a novel dual-action Raf kinase and vascular endothelial 
      growth factor receptor inhibitor that inhibits tumor cell proliferation and 
      angiogenesis. This study established the safety and pharmacokinetics of BAY 
      43-9006 in 69 patients with advanced refractory solid tumors. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: BAY 43-9006 (50 to 800 mg) was administered once or twice daily on a 
      varying weekly schedule. Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed in all patients; 
      preliminary tumor response was also assessed. The effect of BAY 43-9006 on 
      phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated ERK phosphorylation in peripheral blood 
      lymphocytes was studied using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Mild to moderate diarrhea 
      was the most common (55%) treatment-related adverse event. The maximum-tolerated 
      dose was 400 mg bid continuous. Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 diarrhea 
      and fatigue at 800 mg bid, and grade 3 skin toxicity at 600 mg bid. BAY 43-9006 
      pharmacokinetics were highly variable for single and multiple dosing, and 
      toxicity did not appear to be dose dependent. Significant decreases of phorbol 
      myristate acetate-stimulated ERK phosphorylation (P < .01) were identified at 
      doses >/= 200 mg bid continuous. Forty-five patients were assessable for 
      efficacy; one patient had a partial response (hepatocellular carcinoma at 400 mg 
      bid continuous), 25 patients had stable disease, with eight lasting > 6 months 
      and five for >12 months. Eighteen patients had progressive disease, and tumor 
      response could not be evaluated in one patient. CONCLUSION: Oral BAY 43-9006 was 
      well tolerated and appeared to provide some clinical benefits. Based on the 
      results of this study, BAY 43-9006 at 400 mg bid continuous is recommended for 
      ongoing and future studies.

TI  - Preclinical evaluation of AMG 925, a FLT3/CDK4 dual kinase inhibitor for treating 
      acute myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 880-9
LID - 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-13-0858 [doi]
AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a serious unmet medical need. Despite high 
      remission rates with chemotherapy standard-of-care treatment, the disease 
      eventually relapses in a major proportion of patients. Activating Fms-like 
      tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) mutations are found in approximately 30% of patients 
      with AML. Targeting FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase has shown encouraging results 
      in treating FLT3-mutated AML. Responses, however, are not sustained and acquired 
      resistance has been a clinical challenge. Treatment options to overcome 
      resistance are currently the focus of research. We report here the preclinical 
      evaluation of AMG 925, a potent, selective, and bioavailable 
      FLT3/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) dual kinase inhibitor. AMG 925 inhibited 
      AML xenograft tumor growth by 96% to 99% without significant body weight loss. 
      The antitumor activity of AMG 925 correlated with the inhibition of STAT5 and RB 
      phosphorylation, the pharmacodynamic markers for inhibition of FLT3 and CDK4, 
      respectively. In addition, AMG 925 was also found to inhibit FLT3 mutants (e.g., 
      D835Y) that are resistant to the current FLT3 inhibitors (e.g., AC220 and 
      sorafenib). CDK4 is a cyclin D-dependent kinase that plays an essential central 
      role in regulating cell proliferation in response to external growth signals. A 
      critical role of the CDK4-RB pathway in cancer development has been well 
      established. CDK4-specific inhibitors are being developed for treating 
      RB-positive cancer. AMG 925, which combines inhibition of two kinases essential 
      for proliferation and survival of FLT3-mutated AML cells, may improve and prolong 
      clinical responses.

AB  - This phase I, dose-escalation study evaluated the safety, preliminary efficacy 
      and pharmacokinetics of nintedanib, a triple angiokinase inhibitor, in Japanese 
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and mild/moderate liver 
      impairment. Thirty patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma were 
      enrolled to groups, depending on whether liver impairment was mild (group I, 
      aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤2× upper limit of normal 
      and Child-Pugh score 5 [n = 14] or 6 [n = 2]) or moderate (group II, Child-Pugh 
      score 5-6 and aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase >2× to ≤5× 
      upper limit of normal [n = 7] or Child-Pugh score 7 [n = 7]); 22 patients had 
      prior sorafenib treatment. Nintedanib was given twice daily in 28-day cycles 
      until disease progression or unacceptable adverse events, starting at 150 mg 
      (group I) or 100 mg (group II) and escalating to 200 mg. The primary objective 
      was to define the maximum tolerated dose based on occurrence of dose-limiting 
      toxicities during cycle 1 (grade ≥3 non-hematological and grade 4 hematological 
      adverse events). No dose-limiting toxicities were reported during cycle 1 and the 
      maximum tolerated dose for both groups was 200 mg twice daily. The most frequent 
      adverse events were gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and decreased 
      appetite). No patients discontinued nintedanib due to adverse events; 31% of 
      group I and 21% of group II had dose reductions. Median time to progression was 
      2.8 months (95% confidence interval, 1.05-5.52) for group I and 3.2 months (95% 
      confidence interval, 0.95-6.70) for group II. Nintedanib showed a manageable 
      safety profile and efficacy signals, including in patients previously treated 
      with sorafenib. Clinical trial registration NCT01594125; 1199.120

      TArgeted therapy in renal cell cancer-GEnetic- and tumor-related biomarkers for 
      response and toxicity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: For patients with metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC), treatment 
      choice is mainly based on clinical parameters. With many treatments available and 
      the limited response to treatment and associated toxicities, there is much 
      interest in identifying better biomarkers for personalized treatment. EuroTARGET 
      aims to identify and characterize host- and tumor-related biomarkers for 
      prediction of response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in mRCC. Here, we 
      describe the EuroTARGET mRCC patient cohort. METHODS AND MATERIALS: EuroTARGET is 
      a European collaborative project designed as an observational study for which 
      patients with mRCC were recruited prospectively in 62 centers. In addition, 462 
      patients with mRCC from previous studies were included. Detailed clinical 
      information (baseline and follow-up) from all patients was entered in web-based 
      case record forms. Blood was collected for germline DNA and 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses and, where available, fresh-frozen tumor 
      material was collected to perform tumor DNA, RNA, kinome, and methylome analyses. 
      RESULTS: In total, 1,210 patients with mRCC were included. Of these, 920 received 
      a tyrosine kinase inhibitor as first-line targeted treatment (sunitinib [N = 713, 
      78%], sorafenib [N = 41, 4%], or pazopanib [N = 166, 18%]) and had at least 6 
      months of outcome assessment (median follow-up 15.3 months [interquartile range: 
      8.5-30.2 months]). Germline DNA samples were available from 824 of these 
      patients, fresh-frozen tumor material from 142 patients, fresh-frozen normal 
      kidney tissue from 95 patients, and tissue microarrays created from 
      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor material from 247 patients. Of the 920 
      patients, germline DNA variant chip data were successfully generated for 811 
      patients (Illumina HumanOmniExpress BeadChip). For 80 patients, next-generation 
      exome sequencing of germline and tumor DNA was performed, tumor RNA sequencing 
      was performed for 124 patients, kinome activity measured and processed for 121 
      patients (PamChip), and methylome data (Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 
      BeadChip) were created for 116 RCC tissues (and 23 normal kidney tissues). For 73 
      out of the 920 patients, all platform data types were generated. In addition, 40 
      patients were included in a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic phase IV substudy. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of EuroTARGET cohort data will contribute to 
      personalization of therapy for patients with mRCC. The extensive clinical data 
      and multiplatform EuroTARGET data will be freely available.

TI  - Two drug interaction studies of sirolimus in combination with sorafenib or 
      sunitinib in patients with advanced malignancies.
PG  - 1956-63
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-2061 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sirolimus is the prototypical mTOR inhibitor. Sorafenib and sunitinib 
      are small molecule inhibitors of multiple kinases including VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 
      kinases. These agents have different mechanisms of action, providing a strong 
      rationale for combination. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with advanced cancer 
      were assigned to receive either sirolimus or the VEGFR inhibitor alone for a 
      2-week lead-in period, followed by combination therapy. The primary end point of 
      each trial was to determine whether a drug interaction exists between sirolimus 
      and either sorafenib or sunitinib, as defined by a difference in C(max) for each 
      drug alone compared with its C(max) during combination therapy. RESULTS: The 
      sorafenib and sunitinib trials enrolled 34 and 23 patients, respectively. There 
      were no clinically significant differences in C(max) for any of the drugs alone 
      compared with the C(max) during combination therapy. Toxicity profiles were 
      similar to those expected for each drug alone. One patient with adrenal cortical 
      cancer had a partial response to sirolimus and sunitnib. CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus 
      can be safely combined with sorafenib or sunitinib. Our trial design is feasible 
      and informative in screening for potential drug-drug interactions, using a 
      relatively small number of patients and limited pharmacokinetic sampling.

AB  - Over the past decade, the potential of polymeric structures has been investigated 
      to overcome many limitations related to nanosized drug carriers by modulating 
      their toxicity, cellular interactions, stability, and drug-release kinetics. In 
      this study, we have developed a successful nanocomposite consisting of 
      undecylenic acid modified thermally hydrocarbonized porous silicon nanoparticles 
      (UnTHCPSi NPs) loaded with an anticancer drug, sorafenib, and surface-conjugated 
      with heptakis(6-amino-6-deoxy)-β-cyclodextrin (HABCD) to show the impact of the 
      surface polymeric functionalization on the physical and biological properties of 
      the drug-loaded nanoparticles. Cytocompatibility studies showed that the 
      UnTHCPSi-HABCD NPs were not toxic to breast cancer cells. HABCD also enhanced the 
      suspensibility and both the colloidal and plasma stabilities of the UnTHCPSi NPs. 
      UnTHCPSi-HABCD NPs showed a significantly increased interaction with breast 
      cancer cells compared to bare NPs and also sustained the drug release. 
      Furthermore, the sorafenib-loaded UnTHCPSi-HABCD NPs efficiently inhibited cell 
      proliferation of the breast cancer cells.

TI  - Dual GSH-exhausting sorafenib loaded manganese-silica nanodrugs for inducing the 
      ferroptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related 
      deaths. Unfortunately, there is still no completely effective treatment. 
      Ferroptosis could affect the development of HCC by regulating the level of 
      glutathione (GSH), intracellular lipid peroxidation, and other related 
      substances. This paper introduced a new one-pot reaction for the synthesis of 
      manganese doped mesoporous silica nanoparticles (manganese-silica nanoparticles, 
      MMSNs) which could induce ferroptosis of the tumor cells through the consumption 
      of intracellular GSH caused by the degradation of MMSNs. The more amount of 
      MnCl(2) added during the preparation, the larger doping amount of manganese 
      presented in MMSNs. When the molar ratio of TEOS to MnCl(2) was 5:1, the prepared 
      MMSNs had a small size (102.6 ± 3.06 nm), uniform structure (pore sizes of 
      3.67 nm) and large pore volume. Manganese-oxidation bonds of MMSNs could break in 
      high GSH concentration, which in turn consume GSH in the environment rapidly. 
      Sorafenib (SO), an inhibitor of X(c)(-) transport system was loaded in the MMSNs 
      (MMSNs@SO) with a drug loading rate of 2.68 ± 0.32%. MMSNs@SO achieved on-demand 
      drug release in the tumor microenvironment due to the degradation of MMSNs. 
      Subsequently, a significant tumor cell (HepG2) suppression effect of MMSNs@SO was 
      achieved through the consumption of GSH and synthesis inhibition of intracellular 
      GSH. The depletion of GSH led to the inactivity of glutathione peroxidase 4 and 
      increase of intracellular lipid peroxide, which could induce the ferroptosis of 
      HCC cells. In summary, such dual GSH-exhausting nanodrugs have a great potential 
      to induce ferroptosis of HCC cells.

      as a new potent multikinase inhibitor through minor structural modification of 
      our previously reported RAF kinase inhibitor A. In vitro anticancer evaluation of 
      6 showed substantial broad-spectrum antiproliferative activity against 60 human 
      cancer cell lines. In particular, it showed GI50 values of 51.4 and 19 nm against 
      leukemia K-562 and colon carcinoma KM12 cell lines, respectively. Kinase 
      screening of compound 6 revealed its nanomolar-level inhibitory activity of 
      certain oncogenic kinases implicated in both tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. 
      Interestingly, 6 displays IC50 values of 0.82, 3.81, and 53 nm toward Tie2, TrkA, 
      and ABL-1 (wild-type and T315I mutant) kinases, respectively. Moreover, 6 is 
      orally bioavailable with a favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic profile. Compound 6 
      may serve as a promising candidate for further development of potent anticancer 
      chemotherapeutics.

TI  - A phase Ib study of selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) in combination with 
      sorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
PG  - 2210-2215
LID - 10.1093/annonc/mdw415 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment with sorafenib, although associated with inhibition of 
      tumour growth and angiogenesis in in vivo studies, leads to up-regulation of 
      pERK. The addition of MEK inhibition could potentially abrogate this effect and 
      potentiate anti-tumour activity. This phase I study investigated the maximum 
      tolerated dose (MTD), safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and biomarker 
      correlates of selumetinib combined with sorafenib in patients with advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Patients with Child-Pugh (CP) score ≤7 
      were treated with 400 mg twice daily of sorafenib with escalating doses of 
      selumetinib in a 3 + 3 study design. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation 
      period was 28 days. PK of selumetinib was determined. Angiogenic effect was 
      evaluated with dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). 
      RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients of Asian ethnicity were enrolled. The MTD was 
      selumetinib 75 mg daily with sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. DLT included grade 3 
      transaminitis, diarrhoea and fatigue. Most common treatment-related adverse 
      events at MTD (all grades) were diarrhoea (85%), rash (59%), hypertension (44%), 
      fatigue (30%), anorexia (22%) and hand-foot syndrome (22%). Four patients (15%) 
      had PR and 13 (48%) had SD. PR or SD was observed for ≥6 months in seven 
      patients. The median overall survival was 14.4 months. Selumetinib exposures in 
      combination with sorafenib were comparable to other monotherapy studies. A 
      reduction in permeability-surface area product noted in DCE-MRI with treatment 
      correlated with worse survival outcomes. CONCLUSION: The MTD of selumetinib was 
      75 mg daily when combined with sorafenib 400 mg twice a day in CP ≤7 HCC. 
      Acceptable adverse events and encouraging anti-tumour activity warrant further 
      evaluation. DCE-MRI findings deserve prospective evaluation. CLINICALTRIALSGOV

PG  - 161-7
LID - 10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.07.011 [doi]
AB  - The cytochrome P450 isoform CYP3A7 (wildtype) is the major form of CYP in human 
      fetal liver. Since it is not exclusively expressed in the fetus but also in a 
      significant number of adults, CYP3A7 has been moving into the focus of 
      investigation on adverse drug reactions and interindividual differences in drug 
      metabolism in the last few years. In addition, CYP3A7 is overexpressed in 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where it contributes to the elimination of drugs. 
      We here report the development of a convenient and reliable whole-cell system for 
      testing CYP3A7 activity using recombinant fission yeast. As expected, catalytic 
      properties of wild type CYP3A7.1 and its polymorphic form CYP3A7.2 towards DHEA 
      and testosterone resembled those reported previously. Interestingly, both 
      isoforms of CYP3A7 did not metabolize the anti-cancer drug sorafenib (which is 
      approved for the treatment of HCC), while CYP3A4 produced the N-oxide in our 
      system, as expected. This finding suggests that CYP3A7 activity does not 
      influence the effectiveness of this anti-cancer drug against HCC. Furthermore, 
      CYP3A7-expressing fission yeast cells specifically converted a luciferin-derivate 
      (luciferin-PFBE) to a luminescent product and this activity can conveniently be 
      monitored by spectrometry, which allowed the determination of IC₅₀-values for the 
      broad-range P450 inhibitors econazole and miconazole, respectively. We believe 
      that these new tools for a fast and easy investigation of substrates and 
      inhibitors of human CYP3A7 will contribute to the gain of important insights for 
      drug metabolism, efficacy and safety.

TI  - Critical role of sorafenib exposure over time for its antitumor activity in 
      thyroid cancer.
PG  - 569-72
LID - 10.1007/s10637-013-0052-7 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor that targets the VEGF, PDGF and BRAF 
      pathways, has demonstrated significant clinical activity in metastatic 
      differentiated thyroid cancer. However, all patients eventually experience 
      disease progression with a median progression-free survival close to 10 months. 
      Since sorafenib exposure is known to decrease over time, we hypothesized that 
      dose adjustments aiming to restore adequate exposure could lead to further 
      clinical activity. We report, as a proof of concept on a patient with 
      radio-iodine resistant metastatic thyroid cancer, who experienced disease 
      progression after an initial response to sorafenib (400 mg twice daily). Whereas 
      the thyroglobulin-progression-free survival at standard doses was 6 months, 
      iterative dose optimization led to a prolonged progression-free survival up to 
      41 months. Sorafenib doses were increased up to 1600 mg bid, in order to maintain 
      clinical activity, and to restore active plasma concentration, since sorafenib 
      exposure had decreased over the time. Toxicity was mild and manageable for more 
      than 2 years. However, the patient eventually experienced grade 3 proteinuria 
      leading to treatment discontinuation. This observation opens up new horizons for 
      daily management of radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer 
      patients progressing under standard doses of sorafenib, and stress the need to 
      monitor its plasma concentration.

TI  - The lack of the organic cation transporter OCT1 at the plasma membrane of tumor 
      cells precludes a positive response to sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma.
PG  - 15846-15857
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.15029 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib is the drug of choice in the treatment of advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Beneficial effects are limited by mechanisms of 
      chemoresistance, which include downregulation and/or impaired function of plasma 
      membrane transporters accounting for drug uptake. The organic cation transporter 
      1 (OCT1) plays a major role in sorafenib uptake and decreased expression in HCC 
      has been associated with poorer response. METHODS: The multicenter retrospective 
      TRANSFER study involved tumor biopsies from 39 patients with advanced HCC and 
      sorafenib therapy for ≥4 wk. Endpoint was the relationship between 
      clinicopathological features and immunohistological result. Immunostaining was 
      performed using specific primary anti-OCT1-head and anti-OCT1-tail antibodies. 
      Tumors were classified according to a simplified staining score as absent, weak, 
      moderate or strong, taking into account the localization of the staining at the 
      plasma membrane as positive or negative. RESULTS: Results confirmed OCT1 
      downregulation in half of the cases investigated (10% absent, 38% weak). However, 
      only one third of tumors expressing OCT1 displayed plasma membrane location (15% 
      vs. 36% cytosolic expression). When comparing HCC with and without OCT1 
      expression, no different sorafenib response was found. When tumors expressing 
      OCT1 at the plasma membrane were considered separately, a marked longer survival 
      was found (Log Rank p<0.001). No association between OCT1 expression at the 
      plasma membrane with tumor stage, previous treatment with TACE or radiological 
      response was seen.In conclusion, these results indicate that the presence of OCT1 
      at the plasma membrane, rather than its expression levels, is related to better 
      outcome of HCC patients treated with sorafenib.

TI  - Activity of dasatinib, a dual SRC/ABL kinase inhibitor, and IPI-504, a heat shock 
      protein 90 inhibitor, against gastrointestinal stromal tumor-associated 
      PDGFRAD842V mutation.
PG  - 5749-58
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0533 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Activating mutations in platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha 
      (PDGFRA) have been reported in approximately 5% to 10% of patients with 
      gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Imatinib efficiently inhibits the 
      juxtamembrane PDGFRA mutations, whereas many tyrosine kinase domain activation 
      loop PDGFRA mutations confer primary resistance to imatinib. In this study, we 
      compared the efficacy of second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as 
      dasatinib, sorafenib, and nilotinib against two GIST-related PDGFRA mutants, 
      PDGFRA(D842V) and PDGFRA(DeltaDIM842-844). In addition, we sought to investigate 
      the inhibitory effect of the heat shock protein 90 inhibitor, IPI-504, on these 
      mutants. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Primary imatinib-resistant tumor cells and cell 
      lines expressing imatinib-resistant PDGFRA(D842V) or imatinib-sensitive 
      PDGFRA(DeltaDIM842-844) mutants were treated with different concentrations of 
      dasatinib, sorafenib, nilotinib, and IPI-504. The effect of treatment on 
      proliferation, survival, and signaling was determined. RESULTS: All inhibitors 
      tested exhibited a high efficacy toward the PDGFRA(DeltaDIM842-844) mutant. In 
      contrast, ex vivo and in vitro assays revealed that only dasatinib potently 
      inhibited the PDGFRA(D842V) isoform with an IC(50) value of 62 nmol/L. Sorafenib 
      and nilotinib were significantly less efficacious against this mutation, 
      inhibiting the PDGFRA kinase activity at >1,000 and >5,000 nmol/L, and 
      suppressing the proliferation of the cells expressing the PDGFRA(D842V) mutant 
      with an IC(50) value of 239 and 1,310 nmol/L, respectively. IPI-504 treatment 
      potently inhibited PDGFRA kinase activity by inducing the degradation of 
      PDGFRA(D842V) and PDGFRA(DeltaDIM842-844) at 256 and 182 nmol/L, respectively. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with dasatinib or the heat shock protein 90 inhibitor 
      IPI-504 may provide a therapeutic alternative for GIST patients whose tumors 
      carry the imatinib-resistant PDGFRA(D842V) mutant isoform.

PG  - 1429-34
LID - 10.1021/bc400166j [doi]
AB  - For advanced treatment of diseases such as cancer, multicomponent, 
      multifunctional nanoparticles hold great promise. In the current study we report 
      the synthesis of a complex nanoparticle (NP) system with dual drug loading as 
      well as diagnostic properties. To that aim we present a methodology where 
      chemically modified poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) polymer is formulated 
      into a polymer-lipid NP that contains a cytotoxic drug doxorubicin (DOX) in the 
      polymeric core and an anti-angiogenic drug sorafenib (SRF) in the lipidic corona. 
      The NP core also contains gold nanocrystals (AuNCs) for imaging purposes and 
      cyclodextrin molecules to maximize the DOX encapsulation in the NP core. In 
      addition, a near-infrared (NIR) Cy7 dye was incorporated in the coating. To 
      fabricate the NP we used a microfluidics-based technique that offers unique NP 
      synthesis conditions, which allowed for encapsulation and fine-tuning of optimal 
      ratios of all the NP components. NP phantoms could be visualized with computed 
      tomography (CT) and near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging. We observed timed 
      release of the encapsulated drugs, with fast release of the corona drug SRF and 
      delayed release of a core drug DOX. In tumor bearing mice intravenously 
      administered NPs were found to accumulate at the tumor site by fluorescence 
      imaging.

TI  - TGF-β induced chemoresistance in liver cancer is modulated by xenobiotic nuclear 
      receptor PXR.
PG  - 3589-3602
LID - 10.1080/15384101.2019.1693120 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma appears as an extremely angiogenic solid tumor marked by 
      apoptosis evasion, dysregulated cell cycle and low sensitivity to chemotherapy. 
      TGF-β, a multifunctional cytokine, plays a pleiotropic role in the tumor 
      microenvironment and has implications in cancer drug resistance. The current 
      study provides novel evidence that TGF-β signaling contributes to drug resistance 
      in liver cancer cells by inducing the expression of xenobiotic nuclear receptor 
      PXR. We observed that PXR increases the expression of drug efflux transporters; 
      therefore, accounting for exacerbated drug resistance. Additionally, 
      anti-apoptotic nature of PXR contributes to TGF-β mediated chemoresistance as 
      seen by procaspase-3 and Mcl-1 cellular levels. TGF-β binding to the TGF-β 
      receptor triggers a complex downstream signaling cascade through a non-canonical 
      SMAD-independent ERK pathway that leads to increased PXR expression. Activated 
      ERK activates ETS1 transcription factor which is a critical regulator of 
      endogenous PXR expression in hepatic cells. Loss of function of ETS1 abrogates 
      the TGF-β induced PXR expression. Together these findings indicate that PXR 
      modulates TGF-β induced resistance to chemotherapy in liver cancer cells. This 
      underscores the need for combinatorial approaches with focus on PXR antagonism to 
      improve drug effectiveness in hepatocellular carcinoma.Abbreviations: HCC:

AB  - Human ABCG2, a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily, 
      represents a promising target for sensitizing MDR in cancer chemotherapy. 
      Although lots of ABCG2 inhibitors were identified, none of them has been tested 
      clinically, maybe because of several problems such as toxicity or safety and 
      pharmacokinetic uncertainty of compounds with novel chemical structures. One 
      efficient solution is to rediscover new uses for existing drugs with known 
      pharmacokinetics and safety profiles. Here, we found the new use for sorafenib, 
      which has a dual-mode action by inducing ABCG2 degradation in lysosome in 
      addition to inhibiting its function. Previously, we reported some novel 
      dual-acting ABCG2 inhibitors that showed closer similarity to degradation-induced 
      mechanism of action. On the basis of these ABCG2 inhibitors with diverse chemical 
      structures, we developed a pharmacophore model for identifying the critical 
      pharmacophore features necessary for dual-acting ABCG2 inhibitors. Sorafenib 
      forms impressive alignment with the pharmacophore hypothesis, supporting the 
      argument that sorafenib is a potential ABCG2 inhibitor. This is the first article 
      that sorafenib may be a good candidate for chemosensitizing agent targeting 
      ABCG2-mediated MDR. This study may facilitate the rediscovery of new functions of 
      structurally diverse old drugs and provide a more effective and safe way of 
      sensitizing MDR in cancer chemotherapy.

TI  - Risk Factors for Liver Function Deterioration after Transarterial 
      Chemoembolization Refractoriness in Child-Pugh Class A Hepatocellular Carcinoma 
      Patients.
PG  - 147-156
LID - 10.4166/kjg.2020.75.3.147 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: A switch to systemic therapy, such as sorafenib, should be 
      considered for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients refractory to 
      transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). On the other hand, treatment changes are 
      difficult if the liver function worsens to Child-Pugh B or C. Therefore, 
      predicting the risk factors for non-responsiveness to TACE and deteriorating 
      liver function may be helpful. METHODS: Newly diagnosed Child-Pugh A HCC patients 
      who underwent TACE from January 2012 to June 2018 were included. After 1 year, 
      this study evaluated whether there was a treatment response to TACE and whether 
      the Child-Pugh class had worsened. RESULTS: Among 121 patients, 65 were 
      refractory and 56 responded to TACE. In multivariable logistic regression 
      analysis, the tumor size, tumor number, and albumin at the time of the diagnosis 
      of HCC were significant prognostic factors for the treatment response to TACE. 
      Among 65 patients who presented TACE-refractoriness, 27 showed liver function 
      deterioration from Child-Pugh class A to class B or C after TACE. In 
      multivariable logistic regression analysis, bilirubin at the diagnosis of HCC was 
      a significant prognostic factor for liver function deterioration. A predictive 
      algorithm based on the regression equations revealed a sensitivity, specificity, 
      positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 74.1%, 74.5%, 45.5%, 
      and 90.9%, respectively, for TACE-refractoriness and liver function 
      deterioration. CONCLUSIONS: The prognostic model incorporating the tumor size, 
      tumor number, albumin, and bilirubin at the diagnosis of HCC may help identify 
      patients who show a poor response to TACE and aggravation of liver function after 
      TACE, who may benefit from early switching into systemic therapy before liver 
      function aggravation.

TI  - The effect of proton pump inhibitors on survival outcomes in advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma treated with sorafenib.
PG  - 2693-2697
LID - 10.1007/s00432-020-03261-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) and first-line 
      treatment option for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Preliminary 
      evidence indicates proton pump inhibitors (PPI) may affect the absorption of TKIs 
      through decreased gut dissolution. This study aims to evaluate the impact of PPI 
      use on the survival outcomes of advanced HCC patients treated with sorafenib. 
      METHODS: The study was a secondary analysis of individual-participant data from 
      the phase III clinical trial NCT00699374. Cox proportional hazard analysis was 
      used to evaluate the association between baseline PPI use and survival outcomes. 
      Overall survival (OS) was the primary outcome with progression-free survival 
      (PFS) secondary. RESULTS: In a cohort of 542 advanced HCC patients initiating 
      sorafenib treatment, 122 were concomitantly using a PPI at baseline. No 
      significant associations between baseline PPI use and OS were identified on 
      univariable (HR [95% CI]; 1.01 [0.80-1.28], P = 0.93) and adjusted (1.10 
      [0.82-1.41], P = 0.62) analysis. Furthermore, no significant associations between 
      baseline PPI use and PFS were identified on univariable (0.96 [0.76-1.21], 
      P = 0.73) and adjusted (1.11 [0.86-1.44], P = 0.41) analysis. CONCLUSION: In a 
      large high-quality dataset, PPI use was not observed to compromise the survival 
      outcomes of advanced HCC patients initiated on sorafenib.

TI  - Bridging Sunitinib Exposure to Time-to-Tumor Progression in Hepatocellular 
      Carcinoma Patients With Mathematical Modeling of an Angiogenic Biomarker.
PG  - 297-304
LID - 10.1002/psp4.12084 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is third in cancer-related causes of death 
      worldwide and its treatment is a significant unmet medical need. Sunitinib is a 
      selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the angiogenic biomarker: soluble vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (sVEGFR2 ). Sunitinib failed its primary 
      overall survival endpoint in patients with advanced HCC in a phase III trial 
      compared to sorafenib. In the present study, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic 
      modeling was used to link drug-exposure to tumor-growth-inhibition (TGI) and 
      time-to-tumor progression (TTP) through sVEGFR2 dynamics. The results suggest 
      that 1) active drug concentration (i.e., sunitinib and its metabolite) inhibits 
      the release of sVEGFR2 and that such inhibition is associated with TGI, and 2) 
      daily sVEGFR2 exposure is likely a reliable predictor for the TTP in HCC 
      patients. Moreover, the model quantitatively links the dynamics of an 
      angiogenesis biomarker to TTP and accurately predicts observed 
      literature-reported results of placebo treatment.

TI  - Pro-angiogenic TIE-2-expressing monocytes/TEMs as a biomarker of the effect of 
      sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 1011-1017
LID - 10.1002/ijc.30804 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, inhibits tumor angiogenesis and is the 
      first-line systemic therapy for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC). However, due to its limited effects and frequent occurrence of side 
      effects, biomarkers are needed to predict the effects of sorafenib. We considered 
      the possibility of using TIE-2-expressing monocytes (TEMs) to predict the 
      response in sorafenib-treated patients with advanced HCC. TEMs serve as a 
      diagnostic marker of HCC and are related to angiogenesis. We analyzed 25 advanced 
      HCC patients and prospectively evaluated TEMs before (Pre TEMs) and at 1 month 
      after initial therapy (T1m TEMs). The radiologic response was evaluated by 
      modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). Median survival 
      time (MST) was significantly longer in the partial response/stable disease 
      (PR/SD) group (21.8 months) than in the PD group (8.7 months). ΔTEMs (changes of 
      T1m TEMs compared to Pre TEMs) were significantly lower in the PR/SD group than 
      in the PD group. MST of the ΔTEMs low group (14.2 months) was significantly 
      longer than that of the high group (8.7 months). Univariate and multivariate Cox 
      regression analyses showed that ΔTEMs [hazard ratio (HR) = 8.53, 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) = 1.51-48.16, p = 0.015] and Child-Pugh class (HR = 5.59, 95% 
      CI = 1.06-29.63, p = 0.043) were independently associated with overall survival. 
      Our results suggest that ΔTEMs could serve as a biomarker for predicting 
      radiologic response and overall survival in sorafenib-treated patients with 
      advanced HCC.

TI  - Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging pharmacodynamic biomarker 
      study of sorafenib in metastatic renal carcinoma.
PG  - 4572-8
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2007.15.5655 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib is an antiangiogenic agent with activity in renal cancer. We 
      conducted a randomized trial to investigate dynamic contrast magnetic resonance 
      imaging (DCE-MRI) as a pharmacodynamic biomarker. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients 
      were randomly assigned to placebo or 200 or 400 mg twice per day of sorafenib. 
      DCE-MRI was performed at baseline and 4 weeks. DCE-MRI parameters, area under the 
      contrast concentration versus time curve 90 seconds after contrast injection 
      (IAUC(90)), and volume transfer constant of contrast agent (K(trans)) were 
      calculated for a metastatic site selected in a blinded manner. Primary end point 
      was change in K(trans). RESULTS: Of the 56 assessable patients, 48 underwent two 
      MRIs; 44 MRIs were assessable for study end points. Mean K(trans) log ratios were 
      0.131 (standard deviation [SD], 0.315), -0.148 (SD, 0.382), -0.271 (SD, 0.499) in 
      placebo, 200- and 400-mg cohorts, respectively (P = .0077 for trend) 
      corresponding to changes of +14%, -14%, and -24%. IAUC(90) log ratios were 0.041 
      (SD, 0.197), -0.040 (SD, 0.132), -0.356 (SD, 0.411), respectively (P = .0003 for 
      trend), corresponding to changes of +4%, -4%, and -30%. Using a log-rank test, 
      IAUC(90) and K(trans) changes were not associated with progression-free survival 
      (PFS). Patients with high baseline K(trans) had a better PFS (P = .027). 
      CONCLUSION: IAUC(90) and K(trans) are pharmacodynamic biomarkers for sorafenib, 
      but variability is high and magnitude of effect is less than previously reported. 
      Changes in DCE-MRI parameters after 4 weeks of sorafenib are not predictive of 
      PFS, suggesting that these biomarkers are not surrogate end points. The value of 
      baseline K(trans) as a prognostic or predictive biomarker requires additional 
      study.

TI  - LEADOPT: an automatic tool for structure-based lead optimization, and its 
      application in structural optimizations of VEGFR2 and SYK inhibitors.
PG  - 523-38
LID - S0223-5234(15)00115-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ejmech.2015.02.019 [doi]
AB  - Lead optimization is one of the key steps in drug discovery, and currently it is 
      carried out mostly based on experiences of medicinal chemists, which often 
      suffers from low efficiency. In silico methods are thought to be useful in 
      improving the efficiency of lead optimization. Here we describe a new in silico 
      automatic tool for structure-based lead optimization, termed LEADOPT. The 
      structural modifications in LEADOPT mainly include two operations: fragment 
      growing and fragment replacing, which are restricted to carry out in the active 
      pocket of target protein with the core scaffold structure of ligand kept 
      unchanged. The bioactivity of the newly generated molecules is estimated by 
      ligand efficiency rather than a commonly used scoring function. Twelve important 
      pharmacokinetic and toxic properties are evaluated using SCADMET, a program for 
      the prediction of pharmacokinetic and toxic properties. LEADOPT was first 
      evaluated using two retrospective cases, in which it showed a very good 
      performance. LEADOPT was then applied to the structural optimizations of the 
      VEGFR2 inhibitor, sorafenib, and the SYK inhibitor, R406. Though just several 
      compounds were synthesized, we have obtained some compounds that are more potent 
      than sorafenib and R406 in enzymatic and functional assays. All of these have 
      validated, at least to some extent, the effectiveness of LEADOPT.

AB  - Regorafenib has recently been approved for the treatment of colorectal cancer. A 
      bioanalytical liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric assay for this 
      multikinase inhibitor was developed and validated in plasma. The concentration 
      range of the assay was 25-25,000 ng/mL. Protein precipitation with acetonitrile 
      was used as sample pre-treatment with sorafenib as internal standard. The extract 
      was diluted with methanol (25%, v/v) and then injected onto the sub-2 µm 
      particle, bridged ethylsilicia hybrid trifunctional bonded C18 column. Isocratic 
      elution using 0.02% (v/v) formic acid in a methanol-water mixture was used. 
      Compounds were monitored by a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in the selected 
      reaction monitoring mode after positive electrospray ionization. Double 
      logarithmic calibration was used; within-day precisions, between-day precisions, 
      and accuracies were 3.2-9.2, 4.1-12.3 and 94.8-103.0%, respectively. High drug 
      stability was observed under all relevant storage conditions. The assay was used 
      to measure drug concentrations in a pharmacokinetic study in wild-type FVB mice.

TI  - Circulating SCCA-IgM complex is a useful biomarker to predict the outcome of 
      therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
PG  - 448-453
LID - 10.1080/00365513.2017.1336569 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) develops in about 3-4% of cirrhotic 
      patients every year. The squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) has been found 
      elevated in liver cancer specimens by immunohistochemistry, and detected in 
      complex with IgM (SCCA-IgM) in the serum of patients with HCC. The aim of this 
      study was to evaluate the ability of serological SCCA-IgM levels to predict the 
      efficacy of HCC therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 2012 to April 2014, 
      131 patients with a new diagnosis of HCC were enrolled. The HCC diagnosis was 
      made according to the EASL guidelines. The patients were staged and treated 
      according to the BCLC Staging System: BCLC stages A and B were treated with 
      locoregional therapy, and BCLC stage C was treated with Sorafenib. Response to 
      therapy was evaluated according to the mRECIST criteria. Serum SCCA-IgM levels 
      were determined by a commercially available ELISA kit at basal time (T(0)) and 
      after one month of treatment (T(1)). RESULTS: At baseline and one month into 
      therapy, SCCA-IgM levels were significantly lower (p value <.05) in patients who 
      responded to therapy compared to those who did not respond (median SCCA-IgM level 
      [25th + 75th percentile] at T(0):115.1 AU/mL [50.0 + 174.4] vs. 149.1 AU/mL 
      [111.3 + 198.8]; median SCCA-IgM level [25th + 75th percentile] at T(1): 
      113.4 AU/mL [50.0 + 194.2] vs. 170.6 AU/mL [111.7 + 344.2]). CONCLUSION: Our 
      study suggests that the SCCA-IgM determination could be helpful in predicting the 
      response to therapy in patients with HCC.

TI  - Inhibition of mutant KrasG12D-initiated murine pancreatic carcinoma growth by a 
      dual c-Raf and soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor t-CUPM.

AB  - Mutant Kras and chronic pancreatitis are the most common pathological events 
      involved in human pancreatic cancer. It has been demonstrated that c-Raf is 
      responsible for transmitting signals from mutant Ras to its downstream signals 
      including MEK-ERK and for initiating carcinogenesis. The soluble epoxide 
      hydrolase (sEH), a pro-inflammatory enzyme, generally inactivates 
      anti-inflammatory and anti-pain epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs). Herein, we have 
      synthesized a novel compound of 
      trans-4-{4-[3-(4-chloro-3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-ureido]-cyclohexyloxy}-pyridine-2-carboxylic 
      acid methylamide (t-CUPM) via modifying the central phenyl ring of sorafenib and 
      confirmed its dual inhibition of sEH and c-Raf by recombinant kinase activity 
      assay. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed that oral dosing of t-CUPM resulted in 
      higher blood levels than that of sorafenib throughout the complete time course 
      (48 h). The effect of t-CUPM on the inhibition of mutant Kras(G12D)-initiated 
      murine pancreatic cancer cell growth was determined using the mouse pancreatic 
      carcinoma cell model obtained from LSL-Kras(G12D)/Pdx1-Cre mice and showed that 
      t-CUPM significantly inhibited this murine pancreatic carcinoma cell growth both 
      in vitro and in mice in vivo. Inhibition of mutant Kras-transmitted 
      phosphorylations of cRAF/MEK/ERK was demonstrated in these pancreatic cancer 
      cells using Western blot assay and immunohistochemical approach. Modulation of 
      oxylipin profile, particularly increased EETs/DHET ratio by sEH inhibition, was 
      observed in mice treated with t-CUPM. These results indicate that t-CUPM is a 
      highly potential agent to treat pancreatic cancer via simultaneously targeting 
      c-Raf and sEH.

TI  - Phase I/II study of sorafenib in combination with temsirolimus for recurrent 
      glioblastoma or gliosarcoma: North American Brain Tumor Consortium study 05-02.
PG  - 1511-8
LID - 10.1093/neuonc/nos264 [doi]
AB  - The activity of single-agent targeted molecular therapies in glioblastoma has 
      been limited to date. The North American Brain Tumor Consortium examined the 
      safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of combination therapy with sorafenib, a 
      small molecule inhibitor of Raf, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, 
      and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β, and temsirolimus (CCI-779), an 
      inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin. This was a phase I/II study. The 
      phase I component used a standard 3 × 3 dose escalation scheme to determine the 
      safety and tolerability of this combination therapy. The phase II component used 
      a 2-stage design; the primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival 
      (PFS6) rate. Thirteen patients enrolled in the phase I component. The maximum 
      tolerated dosage (MTD) for combination therapy was sorafenib 800 mg daily and 
      temsirolimus 25 mg once weekly. At the MTD, grade 3 thrombocytopenia was the 
      dose-limiting toxicity. Eighteen patients were treated in the phase II component. 
      At interim analysis, the study was terminated and did not proceed to the second 
      stage. No patients remained progression free at 6 months. Median PFS was 8 weeks. 
      The toxicity of this combination therapy resulted in a maximum tolerated dose of 
      temsirolimus that was only one-tenth of the single-agent dose. Minimal activity 
      in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme was seen at the MTD of the 2 combined 
      agents.

TI  - Gemcitabine and docetaxel for hepatocellular carcinoma: a phase II North Central 
      Cancer Treatment Group clinical trial.
PG  - 418-23
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Few effective options are available for the treatment of unresectable 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Several phase I trials suggest promising activity 
      of a combination of gemcitabine and docetaxel. METHODS: Patients with 
      unresectable or metastatic HCC were treated with docetaxel 40 mg/m (later reduced 
      to 30 mg/m) and gemcitabine 800 mg/m on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. Twenty-five 
      patients were enrolled in 26 months. Median age was 64 (range, 27-078), 17 were 
      male, 14 had liver-only disease, and 11 had extrahepatic disease. RESULTS: Of 25 
      patients evaluable for the primary end point (response), 2 (8%) have a confirmed 
      partial response. The median time to progression is 2.76 months (95% confidence 
      interval, 1.84-6.64 mo). Median survival was 12.8 months (95% confidence 
      interval, 5.26-28.00). Two patients died on study owing to adverse events (1 
      hepatic and 1 renal failure), neither of which were attributed to the study 
      medications. Twenty patients (81%) have experienced grade 3+ adverse events, 
      including 11 with grade 4+ adverse events, primarily neutropenia, 
      thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Although this combination 
      seems to have potential benefit, as measured by overall survival, its toxicity 
      and the recent introduction of sorafenib has further limited the use of 
      chemotherapy. Approaches other than chemotherapy are likely to be of the greatest 
      potential benefit.

TI  - Mass spectral analysis of the multikinase inhibitor BZG and its metabolites and 
      analysis of their binding to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2.
PG  - 29951-29962
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.16264 [doi]
AB  - We previously showed that BZG is a novel multitarget kinase inhibitor, which 
      inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma in vivo and in vitro. In the present study, we 
      used ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole 
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS) to characterize BZG and its 
      metabolites generated in vivo. The probable metabolic mechanism was further 
      confirmed by analysis of Phase I and Phase II metabolism in liver microsomes and 
      with recombinant enzymes. In addition, the binding affinities of BZG metabolites 
      to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) were predicted using 
      electronic high throughput screening (eHiTS). The results showed that BZG 
      underwent phase I and phase II metabolism. We detected 11 BZG metabolites and 
      identified hydroxylation, glucuronation, acetylation, sulfonation and degradation 
      as the major metabolic processes in vivo and in vitro. Five of the eleven 
      metabolites showed highly favorable eHiTS energy scores that were lower than 
      sorafenib. Knowledge of the in vivo metabolic pathways of BZG and its binding 
      affinities to VEGFR2 will be beneficial for further clinical development of BZG.

TI  - Cell Membrane-Coated Magnetic Nanocubes with a Homotypic Targeting Ability 
      Increase Intracellular Temperature due to ROS Scavenging and Act as a Versatile 
      Theranostic System for Glioblastoma Multiforme.
PG  - e1900612

AB  - In this study, hybrid nanocubes composed of magnetite (Fe(3) O(4) ) and manganese 
      dioxide (MnO(2) ), coated with U-251 MG cell-derived membranes (CM-NCubes) are 
      synthesized. The CM-NCubes demonstrate a concentration-dependent oxygen 
      generation (up to 15%), and, for the first time in the literature, an 
      intracellular increase of temperature (6 °C) due to the exothermic scavenging 
      reaction of hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2) ) is showed. Internalization studies 
      demonstrate that the CM-NCubes are internalized much faster and at a higher 
      extent by the homotypic U-251 MG cell line compared to other cerebral cell lines. 
      The ability of the CM-NCubes to cross an in vitro model of the blood-brain 
      barrier is also assessed. The CM-NCubes show the ability to respond to a static 
      magnet and to accumulate in cells even under flowing conditions. Moreover, it is 
      demonstrated that 500 µg mL(-1) of sorafenib-loaded or unloaded CM-NCubes are 
      able to induce cell death by apoptosis in U-251 MG spheroids that are used as a 
      tumor model, after their exposure to an alternating magnetic field (AMF). 
      Finally, it is shown that the combination of sorafenib and AMF induces a higher 
      enzymatic activity of caspase 3 and caspase 9, probably due to an increment in 
      reactive oxygen species by means of hyperthermia.

TI  - Multiparameter Phase I trials: a tool for model-based development of targeted 
      agent combinations--example of EVESOR trial.
PG  - 1511-8
LID - 10.2217/fon.15.49 [doi]
AB  - Optimal development of targeted drug combinations is one of the future challenges 
      to be addressed. Computerization and mathematical models able to describe 
      biological phenomena and to simulate the effects of changes in experimental 
      conditions may help find solutions to this issue. We propose the concept of 
      'multiparameter trials', where biological, radiological and clinical data 
      required for modeling purpose are collected and illustrated by the ongoing 
      academic EVESOR trial. The objective of the model-based work would be the 
      determination of the optimized doses and dosing schedules of everolimus and 
      sorafenib, offering the maximization of the predicted modeled benefit/toxicity 
      ratio in patients with solid tumors. It may embody the 'proof of concept' of 
      model-based drug development of anticancer agent combinations.

TI  - The observed correlation between in vivo clinical pharmacokinetic parameters and 
      in vitro potency of VEGFR-2 inhibitors. Can this be used as a prospective guide 
      for the development of novel compounds?
PG  - 194-201
LID - 10.1055/s-0031-1299772 [doi]
AB  - Literature data on the clinical pharmacokinetics of various VEGFR-2 inhibitors 
      along with in vitro potency data were correlated and a linear relationship was 
      established in spite of limited data set. In this work, a model set comprised of 
      axitinib, recentin, sunitinib, pazopanib, and sorafenib were used. The in vitro 
      potencies of the model set compounds were correlated with the published unbound 
      plasma concentrations (Cmax, Cavg, Ctrough). The established linear regression 
      (r2>0.90) equation was used to predict Cmax, Cavg, Ctrough of the 'prediction 
      set' (motesanib, telatinib, CP547632, vatalanib, vandetanib) using in vitro 
      potency and unbound protein free fraction. Cavg and Ctrough of prediction set 
      were closely matched (0.2-1.8 fold of reported), demonstrating the usefulness of 
      such predictions for tracking the target related modulation and/or efficacy 
      signals within the clinically optimized population average. In case of Cmax where 
      correlation was least anticipated, the predicted values were within 0.1-1.1 fold 
      of those reported. Such predictions of appropriate parameters would provide rough 
      estimates of whether or not therapeutically relevant dose(s) have been 
      administered when clinical investigations of novel agents of this class are being 
      performed. Therefore, it may aid in increasing clinical doses to a desired level 
      if safety of the compound does not compromise such dose increases. In conclusion, 
      the proposed model may prospectively guide the dosing strategies and would 
      greatly aid the development of novel compounds in this class.

TI  - Can 111In-RGD2 monitor response to therapy in head and neck tumor xenografts?
PG  - 1849-55
LID - 10.2967/jnumed.114.144394 [doi]
AB  - RGD (arginylglycylaspartic acid)-based imaging tracers allow specific imaging of 
      integrin αvβ3 expression, proteins overexpressed during angiogenesis; however, 
      few studies have investigated the potential of these tracers to monitor responses 
      of antiangiogenic or radiation therapy. In the studies presented here, 
      (111)In-RGD2 was assessed for its potential as an imaging tool to monitor such 
      responses to therapies. METHODS: DOTA-E-[c(RGDfK)]2 was radiolabeled with (111)In 
      ((111)In-RGD2), and biodistribution studies were performed in mice with 
      subcutaneous FaDu or SK-RC-52 xenografts after treatment with either 
      antiangiogenic therapy (bevacizumab or sorafenib) or tumor irradiation (10 Gy). 
      Micro-SPECT imaging studies and subsequent quantitative analysis were also 
      performed. The effect of bevacizumab, sorafenib, or radiation therapy on tumor 
      growth was determined. RESULTS: The uptake of (111)In-RGD2 in tumors, as 
      determined from biodistribution studies, correlated well with that quantified 
      from micro-SPECT images, and both showed that 15 d after irradiation (111)In-RGD2 
      uptake was enhanced. Specific or nonspecific uptake of (111)In-RGD2 in FaDu or 
      SK-RC-52 xenografts was not affected after antiangiogenic therapy, except in head 
      and neck squamous cell carcinoma 19 d after the start of sorafenib therapy (P < 
      0.05). The uptake of (111)In-RGD2 followed tumor volume in studies featuring 
      antiangiogenic therapy. However, the uptake of (111)In-RGD2 in FaDu xenografts 
      was decreased as early as 4 h after tumor irradiation, despite nonspecific uptake 
      remaining unaltered. Tumor growth was inhibited after antiangiogenic or radiation 
      therapy. CONCLUSION: Here, it is suggested that (111)In-RGD2 could allow in vivo 
      monitoring of angiogenic responses after radiotherapy and may therefore prove a 
      good clinical tool to monitor angiogenic responses early after the start of 
      radiotherapy in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Despite 
      clear antitumor efficacy, antiangiogenic therapy did not alter tumor uptake of 
      (111)In-RGD2, indicating that integrin expression was not altered.

TI  - Novel Thiosemicarbazide Hybrids with Amino Acids and Peptides Against 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Molecular Designing Approach Towards Multikinase 
      Inhibitor.
PG  - 279-90
AB  - Hepatocellular Carcinoma is the most common primary malignant tumor of the liver. 
      Development of multidrug resistance is the main obstacle to the success of 
      anticancer drugs. In this study, designing and docking study of thiosemicarbazide 
      hybrids with amino acids or peptides against hepatocellular carcinoma was 
      performed since hybrids of biologically active compounds with amino acids or 
      peptides may show target specificity and lower toxicity. All the structures were 
      drawn in 2D platform and converted to the 3D platform using ChemDraw 10.0. 
      Evaluations of ADME properties were done by using QikProp 3.0 to check for the 
      possibility of oral delivery. In silico prediction of LD50 values were performed 
      using Pro-Tox webserver. Interestingly, it was found that conjugation with amino 
      acids decreases toxicity and increases the therapeutic index of 
      thiosemicarbazide. Finally, all the compounds were docked to the crystal 
      structure of the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2 and Checkpoint 
      kinase-1 utilizing Glide 5.0, Schrödinger 8.5, to understand the interaction of 
      ligands with the receptor. A significant number of derivatives have been found 
      active in both the receptors and also displayed multikinase inhibitory activity 
      similar to Sorafenib, against hepatocellular carcinoma. Further, wet lab 
      synthesis, in vitro ADMET and biological screening studies need to be performed 
      to prove that designed compounds are effective against hepatocellular carcinoma 
      as predicted by molecular modeling. However, as predicted by molecular modeling, 
      the efficacy of designed compounds against hepatocellular carcinoma, needs to be 
      confirmed by wet lab synthesis, in vitro ADMET and biological screening studies.

TI  - Tubulin colchicine site binding agent LL01 displays potent antitumor efficiency 
      both in vitro and in vivo with suitable drug-like properties.

AB  - Through rational drug design, we previously identified an indenoprazole 
      derivative, 
      2-(6-ethoxy-3-(3-ethoxyphenylamino)-1-methyl-1,4-dihydroindeno[1,2-c]pyrazol-7-yloxy)acetamide 
      (LL01), as a potent tubulin polymerization inhibitor targeting the tubulin 
      colchicine binding site. In this study, we further demonstrated that LL01 was not 
      a P-gp substrate. It potently inhibited the growth of a variety of tumor cells, 
      including those with multidrug resistance, with GI(50) values in the low nanomole 
      ranges. In vitro liver microsome stability assay, LL01 was modest stable in the 
      liver microsomes of human, mouse and rat, but was fast metabolized in dog. After 
      single oral administration of LL01 at a dose of 10 mg/kg in SD male rats, LL01 
      showed acceptable PK properties with a mean bioavailability of 41%. In human 
      HepG2 hepatoma xenograft, at the oral doses of 25 mg/kg/day and 12.5 mg/kg/day, 
      LL01 inhibited the tumor growth by 61.27%, and 43.74%, respectively, which is 
      much better than the positive drug sorafenib (29.45%; 30 mg/kg/day). Therefore, 
      LL01 might be a potential drug candidate for further investigation for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma therapy.

TI  - Quantitative therapy response assessment by volumetric iodine-uptake measurement: 
      initial experience in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma treated 
      with sorafenib.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the volumetric iodine-uptake (VIU) changes by 
      dual-energy CT (DECT) in assessing the response to sorafenib treated 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, compared with AASLD (American 
      Association for the Study of Liver Diseases) and Choi criteria. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Fifteen patients with HCC receiving sorafenib, monitored with 
      contrast-enhanced DECT scans at baseline and a minimum of one follow-up (8-12 
      weeks) were retrospectively evaluated. 30 target lesions in total were analyzed 
      for tumor response according to VIU and adapted Choi criteria and compared with 
      the standard AASLD. RESULTS: According to AASLD criteria, 67% target lesions 
      showed disease control: partial response (PR) in 3% and stable disease (SD) in 
      63%. 33% lesions progressed (PD). Disease control rate presented by VIU (60%) was 
      similar to AASLD (67%) and Choi (63%) (P>0.05). For disease control group, change 
      in mean VIU was from 149.5 ± 338.3mg to 108.5 ± 284.1mg (decreased 19.1 ± 42.9%); 
      and for progressive disease group, change in mean VIU was from 163.7 ± 346.7 mg 
      to 263.9 ± 537.2 mg (increased 230.5 ± 253.1%). Compared to AASLD (PR, 3%), VIU 
      and Choi presented more PR (33% and 30%, respectively) in disease control group 
      (P<0.05). VIU has moderate consistency with both AASLD (kappa=0.714; P<0.005) and 
      Choi (kappa=0.648; P<0.005), while VIU showed a better consistency and 
      correlation with AASLD (kappa=0.714; P<0.005; r=0.666, P<0.005) than Choi with 
      AASLD (kappa=0.634, P<0.005; r=0.102, P=0.296). CONCLUSION: VIU measurements by 
      DECT can evaluate the disease control consistent with the current standard AASLD. 
      Measurements are semi-automatic and therefore easy and robust to apply. As VIU 
      reflects vital tumor burden in HCC, it is likely to be an optimal tumor response 
      biomarker in HCC.

      Antagonist.
PG  - 9885-9904

AB  - The most common solid tumors show intrinsic multidrug resistance (MDR) or 
      inevitably acquire such when treated with anticancer drugs. In this work, we 
      describe the discovery of a peripherally restricted, potent, competitive NMDA 
      receptor antagonist 1l by a structure-activity study of the broad-acting 
      ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist 1a. Subsequently, we demonstrate that 1l 
      augments the cytotoxic action of sorafenib in murine hepatocellular carcinoma 
      cells. The underlying biological mechanism was shown to be interference with the 
      lipid signaling pathway, leading to reduced expression of MDR transporters and 
      thereby an increased accumulation of sorafenib in the cancer cells. Interference 
      with lipid signaling pathways by NMDA receptor inhibition is a novel and 
      promising strategy for reversing transporter-mediated chemoresistance in cancer 
      cells.

TI  - In comparative analysis of multi-kinase inhibitors for targeted medulloblastoma 
      therapy pazopanib exhibits promising in vitro and in vivo efficacy.
PG  - 7149-61
AB  - Regardless of the recent advances in cytotoxic therapies, 30% of children 
      diagnosed with medulloblastoma. succumb to the disease. Therefore, novel 
      therapeutic approaches are warranted. Here we demonstrate that Pazopanib a 
      clinically approved multi-kinase angiogenesis inhibitor (MKI) inhibits 
      proliferation and apoptosis in medulloblastoma cell lines. Moreover, Pazopanib 
      profoundly attenuates medulloblastoma cell migration, a prerequisite for tumor 
      invasion and metastasis. In keeping with the observed anti-neoplastic activity of 
      Pazopanib, we also delineate reduced phosphorylation of the STAT3 protein, a key 
      regulator of medulloblastoma proliferation and cell survival. Finally, we 
      document profound in vivo activity of Pazopanib in an orthotopic mouse model of 
      the most aggressive c-myc amplified human medulloblastoma variant. Pazopanib 
      reduced the growth rate of intracranial growing medulloblastoma and significantly 
      prolonged the survival. Furthermore, to put these results into a broader 
      perspective we analysed Pazopanib side by side with the MKI Sorafenib. Both 
      compounds share a similar target profile but display different pharmacodynamics 
      and pharmacokinetics with distinct cytotoxic activity in different tumor 
      entities. Thus, we identified Pazopanib as a new promising candidate for a 
      rational clinical assessment for targeted paediatric medulloblastoma therapy.

AB  - In this paper, we report the preparation of LbL-nanoSraf (100-300nm) comprising 
      of layer-by-layer (LbL) assembled polyelectrolytes 
      dextran-sulfate/poly-l-arginine, with a multikinase inhibitor sorafenib (Sraf) 
      encapsulated calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticles for oral cancer therapy in 
      vitro. The zeta potential of LbL-nanoSraf exhibited a negative charge of the 
      polyanionic dextran sulfate, which alternated with a positive charge of 
      polycationic poly-l-arginine indicating a successful LbL assembly of the two 
      polyelectrolyte bilayers on the CaCO3 nanoparticles. The LbL-nanoSraf exhibited 
      an encapsulation efficiency of 61±4%. The LbL-nanoSraf was characterized using 
      field-emission gun scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, atomic 
      force microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Confocal laser scanning 
      microscopy, flow cytometry and transmission electron microscopic investigations 
      showed the internalization of LbL-nanoSraf in human oral cancer (KB) cells. The 
      LbL-nanoSraf exhibited more potent antiproliferative, apoptotic and antimigratory 
      activities in KB cells than the free drug Sraf. The findings could promote the 
      application of nano-sized LbL assembled polyelectrolytes for the delivery of 
      Raf-kinase inhibitors and provide mechanistic insights for oral cancer therapy.

TI  - Matrix Metalloproteinase Responsive Nanoparticles for Synergistic Treatment of 
      Colorectal Cancer via Simultaneous Anti-Angiogenesis and Chemotherapy.
PG  - 2943-2953
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.6b00643 [doi]
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide, 
      especially in developed countries. Although patients' overall survival has been 
      improved by either conventional chemotherapy or newly developed anti-angiogenesis 
      treatment based on its highly vascularized feature, the relatively low 
      therapeutic efficacy and severe side effects remain big problems in clinical 
      practice. In this study, we describe an easy method to construct a novel matrix 
      metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) responsive nanocarrier, which can load hydrophobic 
      agents (camptothecin and sorafenib) with high efficiency to exert synergistic 
      efficacy for CRC treatment. The drug-containing nanoparticles can particularly 
      respond to the MMP-2 and realize the controlled release of payloads at the tumor 
      site. Moreover, both in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that this 
      responsive nanoparticle exhibits much higher therapeutic efficacy than that of 
      single antitumor agents or combined drugs coadministrated in traditional ways.

TI  - Prognosis of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a new stratification of Barcelona 
      Clinic Liver Cancer stage C: results from a French multicenter study.
PG  - 433-40
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000000558 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) includes a wide spectrum of 
      tumors and patients' prognosis after treatment is highly variable. Moreover, 
      therapeutic options based on the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging 
      system algorithm are restricted to one systemic therapy. AIM OF THE STUDY: To 
      refine the stratification among BCLC C HCC patients by establishing a new simple 
      prognostic score. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A regression model based on a BCLC stage 
      C population and validated with an external cohort of BCLC C HCC patients defined 
      the score. It was therefore validated among three external cohorts of BCLC C HCC 
      patients treated with sorafenib. RESULTS: Five variables had independent 
      prognostic values: the number of nodules, the infiltrating nature of the HCC, 
      α-fetoprotein serum level, Child-Pugh score, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
      Group Performance Status grade. They were integrated into a new score named NIACE 
      ranging from 0 to 7, well correlated with survival. With the use of one threshold 
      value, this score enables defining of two populations with different survivals 
      among BCLC C patients and specifically among those treated with sorafenib. 
      CONCLUSION: The NIACE score defines different prognostic subgroups after 
      palliative treatment of HCC. It could be an additional tool for BCLC C HCC before 
      inclusion in clinical trials or for the management of patients. These results 
      must be validated in a prospective study.

TI  - Phase I study of dovitinib (TKI258), an oral FGFR, VEGFR, and PDGFR inhibitor, in 
      advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
PG  - 1257-68
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-2885 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Signaling through the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathway may account 
      for tumor resistance to antiangiogenic therapies targeting the VEGF pathway. 
      Here, dovitinib (TKI258), a potent oral inhibitor of FGF receptor, VEGF receptor 
      (VEGFR), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, is studied 
      in a dose escalation trial. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with advanced or 
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with predominant clear cell histology were 
      treated with oral dovitinib 500 or 600 mg/day (5-days-on/2-days-off schedule). 
      RESULTS: Twenty heavily pretreated patients (median 3 prior regimens) were 
      enrolled, with 16, 11, and 12 patients having previously received at least 1: 
      VEGFR inhibitor, mTOR inhibitor, and immunotherapy, respectively. Fifteen and 5 
      patients were treated in 500- and 600-mg cohorts, respectively. Three patients 
      experienced dose-limiting toxicities: grade 2 bradycardia (500 mg), grade 4 
      hypertensive crisis (600 mg), and grade 3 asthenia with grade 2 nausea and 
      vomiting (600 mg). The most common adverse events related to dovitinib were 
      nausea (75%), diarrhea (70%), vomiting (70%), and asthenia (50%), the majority of 
      which were mild (grade 1 or 2), with grade 3 events 5% or less (except asthenia, 
      15%) and only one grade 4 event (hypertensive crisis). Two patients achieved a 
      partial response (500 mg), and 12 patients had stable disease, including 2 
      patients with long lasting disease stabilizations (>1 year) in the 500-mg cohort. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Dovitinib was tolerable and showed antitumor activity at a maximum 
      tolerated dose of 500 mg on a 5-days-on/2-days-off schedule in heavily pretreated 
      RCC patients.

TI  - In vivo RAF signal transduction as a potential biomarker for sorafenib efficacy 
      in patients with neuroendocrine tumours.
PG  - 1298-305
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2013.64 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Targeted therapies elicit anticancer activity by exerting 
      pharmacodynamic effects on specific molecular targets. Currently, there is 
      limited use of pharmacodynamic assessment to guide drug administration in the 
      routine oncology setting. METHODS: We developed a phosphoshift (pShift) flow 
      cytometry-based test that measures RAF signal transduction capacity in peripheral 
      blood cells, and evaluated it in a phase II clinical trial of oral sorafenib plus 
      low-dose cyclophosphamide in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumours 
      (NETs), in order to predict clinical course and/or guide individual 
      dose-titration. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were enrolled. Median 
      progression-free survival (PFS) was 3 months (95% CI 2-10.7), and one patient had 
      a partial response. PFS was longer among five patients who demonstrated an 
      increase in pShift after 7 days of sorafenib compared with those who did not 
      (14.9 months vs 2.8 months; P=0.047). However, pShift did not add value to 
      toxicity-based dose-titration. CONCLUSION: The pharmacodynamic assessment of RAF 
      transduction may identify selected patients with advanced NETs most likely to 
      benefit from the combination of sorafenib plus cyclophosphamide. Further 
      investigation of this test as a potential biomarker is warranted.

TI  - The isothiocyanate erucin abrogates telomerase in hepatocellular carcinoma cells 
      in vitro and in an orthotopic xenograft tumour model of HCC.
PG  - 2393-403
LID - 10.1111/jcmm.12412 [doi]
AB  - In contrast to cancer cells, most normal human cells have no or low telomerase 
      levels which makes it an attractive target for anti-cancer drugs. The small 
      molecule sulforaphane from broccoli is known for its cancer therapeutic potential 
      in vitro and in vivo. In animals and humans it was found to be quickly 
      metabolized into 4-methylthiobutyl isothiocyanate (MTBITC, erucin) which we 
      recently identified as strong selective apoptosis inducer in hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) cells. Here, we investigated the relevance of telomerase 
      abrogation for cytotoxic efficacy of MTBITC against HCC. The drug was effective 
      against telomerase, independent from TP53 and MTBITC also blocked telomerase in 
      chemoresistant subpopulations. By using an orthotopic human liver cancer 
      xenograft model, we give first evidence that MTBITC at 50 mg/KG b.w./d 
      significantly decreased telomerase activity in vivo without affecting enzyme 
      activity of adjacent normal tissue. Upon drug exposure, telomerase decrease was 
      consistent with a dose-dependent switch to anti-survival, cell arrest and 
      apoptosis in our in vitro HCC models. Blocking telomerase by the specific 
      inhibitor TMPyP4 further sensitized cancer cells to MTBITC-mediated cytotoxicity. 
      Overexpression of hTERT, but not enzyme activity deficient DNhTERT, protected 
      against apoptosis; neither DNA damage nor cytostasis induction by MTBITC was 
      prevented by hTERT overexpression. These findings imply that telomerase enzyme 
      activity does not protect against MTBITC-induced DNA damage but impacts 
      signalling processes upstream of apoptosis execution level.

TI  - Assessment of Outcome of Hepatic Arterial Infusion Chemotherapy in Patients with 
      Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma by the Combination of RECIST and Tumor Markers.
PG  - 25-33
AB  - To assess the outcome of stable disease (SD) patients with advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by tumor markers after the first course of hepatic 
      arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC). The study subjects were 156 HCC patients 
      treated with HAIC and classified as Child Pugh A, with no extrahepatic 
      metastasis, and no history of sorafenib treatment. In the study and validation 
      cohorts, the AFP and DCP ratios of patients who were considered SD to the first 
      course of HAIC were analyzed by AUROC for a prediction of response to the second 
      course of HAIC. The imaging response to the first course of HAIC was classified 
      as partial response (PR), SD and progressive disease (PD) in 29 (18.8%), 80 
      (51.9%), and 44 (28.6%) patients respectively. For SD patients, the a-fetoprotein 
      (AFP) and des-y-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) ratios of patients who were considered 
      SD to the first course of HAIC were analyzed by the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve for prediction of response to the second course of HAIC in 
      the study cohorts. The area under the curve of AFP ratio was 0.743. The area 
      under the curve of DCP ratio was 0.695. The cut-off values of AFP and DCP ratios 
      were 1.3 and 1.0, respectively. In the validation cohort, the accuracy of the 
      prediction of response in this validation cohort (71.4%) showed no significant 
      difference compared to that in the study cohort (72.4%) (p = 1.0). The results 
      suggested that patients with a high tumor marker ratio could be switched to 
      alternative therapeutic regimens despite the SD response to HAIC.

TI  - A method of gene expression data transfer from cell lines to cancer patients for 
      machine-learning prediction of drug efficiency.
PG  - 486-491
LID - 10.1080/15384101.2017.1417706 [doi]
AB  - Personalized medicine implies that distinct treatment methods are prescribed to 
      individual patients according several features that may be obtained from, e.g., 
      gene expression profile. The majority of machine learning methods suffer from the 
      deficiency of preceding cases, i.e. the gene expression data on patients combined 
      with the confirmed outcome of known treatment methods. At the same time, there 
      exist thousands of various cell lines that were treated with hundreds of 
      anti-cancer drugs in order to check the ability of these drugs to stop the cell 
      proliferation, and all these cell line cultures were profiled in terms of their 
      gene expression. Here we present a new approach in machine learning, which can 
      predict clinical efficiency of anti-cancer drugs for individual patients by 
      transferring features obtained from the expression-based data from cell lines. 
      The method was validated on three datasets for cancer-like diseases (chronic 
      myeloid leukemia, as well as lung adenocarcinoma and renal carcinoma) treated 
      with targeted drugs - kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib or sorafenib.

TI  - Sorafenib dose escalation is not uniformly associated with blood pressure 
      elevations in normotensive patients with advanced malignancies.
PG  - 27-35
LID - 10.1038/clpt.2014.63 [doi]
AB  - Hypertension after treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 
      receptor inhibitors is associated with superior treatment outcomes for advanced 
      cancer patients. To determine whether increased sorafenib doses cause incremental 
      increases in blood pressure (BP), we measured 12-h ambulatory BP in 41 
      normotensive advanced solid tumor patients in a randomized dose-escalation study. 
      After 7 days' treatment (400 mg b.i.d.), mean diastolic BP (DBP) increased in 
      both study groups. After dose escalation, group A (400 mg t.i.d.) had marginally 
      significant further increase in 12-h mean DBP (P = 0.053), but group B (600 mg 
      b.i.d.) did not achieve statistically significant increases (P = 0.25). Within 
      groups, individuals varied in BP response to sorafenib dose escalation, but these 
      differences did not correlate with changes in steady-state plasma sorafenib 
      concentrations. These findings in normotensive patients suggest BP is a complex 
      pharmacodynamic biomarker of VEGF inhibition. Patients have intrinsic differences 
      in sensitivity to sorafenib's BP-elevating effects.

TI  - Validation of a liquid chromatography assay for the quantification of the Raf 
      kinase inhibitor BAY 43-9006 in small volumes of mouse serum.
PG  - 99-103
AB  - BAY 43-9006 is a selective Raf-1 kinase inhibitor with antitumor activity against 
      a variety of human cancers. A highly sensitive HPLC method for determination of 
      BAY 43-9006 in small volumes of serum (30 microl) was developed. Sample 
      preparation involved a liquid-liquid extraction procedure with tolnaftate as 
      internal standard followed by linear gradient elution at a reversed phase C18 
      column and UV detection. The method was selective and the calibration curves were 
      linear over the concentration range of 80-2000 ng/ml. The intra-day accuracy 
      ranged from 99.9 to 107.6% and the inter-day accuracy from 94.6 to 115%. The 
      lower limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 80 ng/ml with an accuracy of 105.8%. Thus, 
      this method has been validated and can be applied for the drug monitoring or 
      pharmacokinetic studies of BAY 43-9006 in small volumes of serum samples.

      inhibitors.
PG  - 5639-55
LID - 10.1021/jm100383b [doi]
AB  - Mutated BRAF serine/threonine kinase is implicated in several types of cancer, 
      with particularly high frequency in melanoma and colorectal carcinoma. We 
      recently reported on the development of BRAF inhibitors based on a tripartite 
      A-B-C system featuring an imidazo[4,5]pyridin-2-one group hinge binder. Here we 
      present the design, synthesis, and optimization of a new series of inhibitors 
      with a different A-B-C system that has been modified by the introduction of a 
      range of novel hinge binders (A ring). The optimization of the hinge binding 
      moiety has enabled the development of compounds with low nanomolar potencies in 
      both BRAF inhibition and cellular assays. These compounds display optimal 
      pharmacokinetic properties that warrant further in vivo investigations.

PG  - 661-671
LID - 10.1007/s00280-017-3242-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: RO5323441 is a humanized anti-placental growth factor (PlGF) monoclonal 
      antibody that has shown preclinical activity in several cancer models. The 
      objective of this analysis is to examine the pharmacokinetic (PK) results from 
      four Phase I studies that have been conducted with RO5323441 (n = 61) and to 
      report an apparent drug-drug interaction observed when RO5323441 was administered 
      in combination with bevacizumab. METHODS: The four Phase I studies were a 
      multiple-ascending dose study in 23 patients with solid tumors (Study 1), an 
      open-label study in seven patients with colorectal/ovarian cancer (Study 2), a 
      sorafenib combination study in nine patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (Study 
      3), and a bevacizumab combination study in 22 patients with recurrent 
      glioblastoma (Study 4). A two-compartment linear population PK model was 
      developed from these four studies to characterize the PK of RO5323441 in patients 
      with cancer. RESULTS: The PK properties of RO5323441 were similar in the first 
      three studies. However, substantially higher RO5323441 exposures were observed in 
      Study 4 when RO5323441 was administered in combination with bevacizumab. A linear 
      two-compartmental population PK model indicated that the co-administration of 
      bevacizumab would decrease the clearance of RO5323441 by 53%. Clinical data 
      suggested that the decrease in RO5323441 clearance was inversely associated with 
      bevacizumab exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The exact reason for the increase in RO5323441 
      exposure following bevacizumab co-administration is not currently known. One 
      possibility is a drug-drug interaction via a target-trapping mechanism that is 
      mediated by the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1).

TI  - Use of sorafenib in two metastatic renal cell cancer patients with end-stage 
      renal impairment undergoing replacement hemodialysis.
PG  - 542-4
AB  - Patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) may exhibit renal impairment as a more 
      or less direct consequence of their primary disease. Renal impairment may become 
      a severe complication and alter the normal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      behavior of treatment drugs, thus increasing the risk of side effects. We will 
      discuss the cases of two advanced RCC patients with end-stage renal impairment 
      submitted to dialysis who were treated with sorafenib tosylate in our center. Our 
      experience confirms the scarce literature data available so far that indicate 
      that sorafenib can be used in patients undergoing dialysis. Dialysis cannot be 
      considered per se a contraindication to sorafenib therapy, which can be 
      effective. However, patients must be carefully selected and monitored, since 
      sorafenib administration unquestionably increases the risk of side effects in 
      patients affected by several conditions.

TI  - The importance of drug metabolites synthesis: the case-study of cardiotoxic 
      anticancer drugs.

AB  - Anticancer drugs are presently guarantying more survivors as a result of more 
      powerful drugs or combinations of drugs used in therapy. Thus, it has become more 
      crucial to study and overcome the side effects of these therapies. Cardiotoxicity 
      is one of the most relevant side effects on the long-term cancer survivors, 
      because of its high social and economic impact. Drug metabolism can result in 
      active metabolites or toxic metabolites that can lead to important side effects. 
      The metabolites of anticancer drugs are possible culprits of cardiotoxicity; 
      however, the cardiotoxicity of many of the metabolites in several drug classes 
      was not yet suitably studied so far. On the other hand, the use of prodrugs that 
      are bioactivated through metabolism can be a good alternative to obtain more 
      cardio safe drugs. In this review, the methods to obtain and study metabolites 
      are summarized and their application to the study of a group of anticancer drugs 
      with acknowledged cardiotoxicity is highlighted. In this group of drugs, 
      doxorubicin (DOX, 1), mitoxantrone (MTX, 2), cyclophosphamide (CTX, 3) and 
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU, 4) are included, as well as the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, 
      such as imatinib (5), sunitinib (6) and sorafenib (7). Only with the synthesis 
      and purification of considerable amounts of the metabolites can reliable studies 
      be performed, either in vitro or in vivo that allow accurate conclusions 
      regarding the cardiotoxicity of anticancer drug metabolites and then 
      pharmacological prevention or treatment of the cardiac side effects can be done.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for ∼90 % of all liver cancer cases, 
      which was the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide in 2020. 
      Glypican-3 (GPC3) is highly and specifically expressed in HCC, which makes it a 
      promising therapeutic target. We discovered novel antibody sequences against GPC3 
      from a phage display library and ranked the candidates by their binding affinity 
      and epitope bins. Candidates with single- to double-digit nanomolar affinity were 
      selected and expressed in Fab format and linked to a deimmunized bacterial 
      exotoxin moiety via an intein trans-splicing reaction. The resulting immunotoxins 
      were evaluated for their in vitro binding specificity and affinity, cell surface 
      binding on the HepG2 or Huh7, rate of internalization, and potency of 
      cytotoxicity. The immunotoxin called GT5 exhibited strong antigen binding and 
      cell surface binding, as well as high internalization efficiency. The molecule 
      GT5 was further evaluated for cytotoxicity in HepG2 and Huh7 cell-based assay and 
      assessed for its pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity in a murine tumor 
      xenograft model. GT5 significantly inhibited tumor growth and showed stronger 
      potency than the chemotherapeutic drug sorafenib. In conclusion, GT5, a novel 
      GPC3 targeting immunotoxin, was shown to have a high affinity towards GPC3 and 
      effectively inhibit hepatocellular tumor growth in vitro and in vivo, thus 
      providing the basis for further development of GT5 immunotoxin as a novel 
      therapeutic modality for the treatment of liver cancer.

TI  - PG545, a dual heparanase and angiogenesis inhibitor, induces potent anti-tumour 
      and anti-metastatic efficacy in preclinical models.
PG  - 635-42
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2011.11 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: PG545 is a heparan sulfate (HS) mimetic that inhibits tumour 
      angiogenesis by sequestering angiogenic growth factors in the extracellular 
      matrix (ECM), thus limiting subsequent binding to receptors. Importantly, PG545 
      also inhibits heparanase, the only endoglycosidase which cleaves HS chains in the 
      ECM. The aim of the study was to assess PG545 in various solid tumour and 
      metastasis models. METHODS: The anti-angiogenic, anti-tumour and anti-metastatic 
      properties of PG545 were assessed using in vivo angiogenesis, solid tumour and 
      metastasis models. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data were also generated in 
      tumour-bearing mice to gain an understanding of optimal dosing schedules and 
      regimens. RESULTS: PG545 was shown to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo and induce 
      anti-tumour or anti-metastatic effects in murine models of breast, prostate, 
      liver, lung, colon, head and neck cancers and melanoma. Enhanced anti-tumour 
      activity was also noted when used in combination with sorafenib in a liver cancer 
      model. PK data revealed that the half-life of PG545 was relatively long, with 
      pharmacologically relevant concentrations of radiolabeled PG545 observed in liver 
      tumours. CONCLUSION: PG545 is a new anti-angiogenic clinical candidate for cancer 
      therapy. The anti-metastatic property of PG545, likely due to the inhibition of 
      heparanase, may prove to be a critical attribute as the compound enters phase I 
      clinical trials.

TI  - Helix-Coil Transition Signatures B-Raf V600E Mutation and Virtual Screening for 
      Inhibitors Directed Against Mutant B-Raf.
PG  - 527-534
LID - 10.2174/1389200218666170503114611 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mutation in the B RAF at V600E has been well implicated in the 
      carcinogenesis that makes it as an attractive therapeutictarget. In the present 
      study, we sought to identify the basis of V600E mutation at functional and 
      structural grounds. The study also endeavors in identification of small molecule 
      as a potential candidate with considerable pharmacological profile than available 
      BRAF inhibitors through computational approaches. METHODS: The functional effects 
      of V600E mutation was predicted using SIFT and Polyphen servers. Protein 
      structural alterations werepredicted using SDM server and RMSD calculations. 
      Virtual screening was performed considering existing BRAF inhibitors viz., 
      Vemurafenib, Sorafenib, Dabrfenib, Trametinibthat formed query compounds for 
      shape similarity search by Tanimoto similarity indices with a threshold of 95%. 
      Compound with high affinity as similar to query compound was retrieved and 
      screened for its ADMET properties. RESULTS: The SNP was shown to be highly 
      vulnerable to malfunction and have damaging effects. Mutated protein showed that 
      the secondary structure was irregular and side chain hydrogen bonds were 
      unsaturated. The superimposition of wild onto mutated V600E BRAF revealed 
      helix-coil transition occurring wherein residues Val 502, Leu 505, Arg506, Lys 
      507 assumed coiled conformation in the mutated BRAF. Virtual screening led to 
      identification of SCHEMBL298689 akin to Vemurafenib as high affinity B-Raf 
      inhibitors; with least toxicity and optimal bioactivity. CONCLUSION: In the 
      present investigation, we put forth the structural and functional basis of B RAF 
      V600E mutation showing helix coil transitions. In addition identified high 
      affinity compound targeting V600E B RAF through virtual screening.

TI  - Crenolanib is a potent inhibitor of FLT3 with activity against 
      resistance-conferring point mutants.
PG  - 94-100
LID - 10.1182/blood-2013-10-529313 [doi]
AB  - Mutations of the type III receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 occur in approximately 
      30% of acute myeloid leukemia patients and lead to constitutive activation. This 
      has made FLT3-activating mutations an attractive drug target because they are 
      probable driver mutations of this disease. As more potent FLT3 inhibitors are 
      developed, a predictable development of resistance-conferring point mutations, 
      commonly at residue D835, has been observed. Crenolanib is a highly selective and 
      potent FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with activity against the internal 
      tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) mutants and the FLT3/D835 point mutants. We tested 
      crenolanib against a panel of D835 mutant cell lines and primary patient blasts 
      and observed superior cytotoxic effects when compared with other available FLT3 
      TKIs such as quizartinib and sorafenib. Another potential advantage of crenolanib 
      is its reduced inhibition of c-Kit compared with quizartinib. In progenitor cell 
      assays, crenolanib was less disruptive of erythroid colony growth, which may 
      result in relatively less myelosuppression than quizartinib. Finally, correlative 
      data from an ongoing clinical trial demonstrate that acute myeloid leukemia 
      patients can achieve sufficient levels of crenolanib to inhibit both FLT3/ITD and 
      resistance-conferring FLT3/D835 mutants in vivo. Crenolanib is thus an important 
      next-generation FLT3 TKI.

AB  - PURPOSE: We assessed the safety of the multikinase inhibitor regorafenib in 
      patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that had progressed following 
      first-line sorafenib. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-six patients with Barcelona 
      Clinic Liver Cancer stage B or C HCC and preserved to mildly impaired liver 
      function (Child-Pugh class A) received regorafenib 160 mg once daily in cycles of 
      3 weeks on/1 week off treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, 
      death or patient/physician decision to discontinue. The primary end-point was 
      safety; secondary end-points included efficacy (including time to progression and 
      overall survival). RESULTS: The median treatment duration was 19.5 weeks (range 
      2-103). At data cutoff, three patients remained on treatment. Reasons for 
      discontinuation were adverse events (n=20), disease progression (n=10), consent 
      withdrawal (n=2) and death (n=1). Seventeen patients required dose reductions 
      (mostly for adverse events [n=15]); 35 patients had treatment interruption 
      (mostly for adverse events [n=32] or patient error [n=11]). The most frequent 
      treatment-related adverse events were hand-foot skin reaction (any grade n=19; 
      grade ≥3 n=5), diarrhoea (n=19; n=2), fatigue (n=19; n=6), hypothyroidism (n=15; 
      n=0), anorexia (n=13; n=0), hypertension (n=13; n=1), nausea (n=12; n=0) and 
      voice changes (n=10; n=0). Disease control was achieved in 26 patients (partial 
      response n=1; stable disease n=25). Median time to progression was 4.3 months. 
      Median overall survival was 13.8 months. CONCLUSION: Regorafenib had acceptable 
      tolerability and evidence of antitumour activity in patients with intermediate or 
      advanced HCC that progressed following first-line sorafenib.

TI  - DM1 Loaded Ultrasmall Gold Nanoparticles Display Significant Efficacy and 
      Improved Tolerability in Murine Models of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 703-713
LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.8b00873 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide with 
      poor prognosis and limited options for treatment. Life expectancy after diagnosis 
      is short; the currently available treatments are not well tolerated and have 
      limited clinical benefit. There is a clear unmet clinical need for the 
      development of new treatments. In this study, ultrasmall, 2 nm gold core 
      nanoparticles (MidaCore) conjugated with the potent maytansine analogue DM1 
      (MTC-100038) were assessed as a systemic nanomedicine for the treatment of 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. The platform improved overall tolerability of DM1, 
      permitting ∼3-fold higher levels of drug to be administered compared to free 
      drug. Dose for dose, MTC-100038 also facilitated delivery of ∼2.0-fold higher ( p 
      = 0.039) levels of DM1 to the tumor compared to free DM1. MTC-100038 produced 
      significant efficacy (tumor growth index ∼102%; p = <0.0001), in several murine 
      xenograft models of HCC, and was superior to both free DM1 and the current 
      standard of care, sorafenib. Furthermore, MTC-100038 displayed potent (nM) in 
      vitro activity in various HCC primary patient derived cell lines and across 
      various other different cancer cell types. These data demonstrate the potential 
      of MidaCore nanoparticles to enhance tumor delivery of cytotoxic drugs and 
      indicate MTC-100038 is worthy of further investigation as a potential treatment 
      for HCC and other cancer types.

LID - 10.1517/14656566.2011.636032 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Targets for drug development for the treatment of kidney cancer 
      (renal cell carcinoma; RCC) include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and 
      its receptors and mammalian target of rapamycin. Currently available oral 
      multitargeted VEGF tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that have been approved by 
      the US Food and Drug Administration for advanced RCC, include sunitinib, 
      sorafenib and pazopanib. Off-target TKI inhibition can potentially preclude 
      full-dose combination with other targeted and chemotherapeutic agents. There is a 
      need to develop more potent and selective targeted agents for RCC therapy, which 
      are more effective and have minimal off-target effects. AREAS COVERED: This drug 
      evaluation review addresses the ongoing development for the treatment of RCC with 
      tivozanib: a potent, selective and long-half-life VEGF TKI. The testing for 
      clinical efficacy alone or in combination with other therapies for RCC and for 
      other tumor types, and the clinical and market relevance of introducing another 
      RCC therapy are discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Tivozanib is distinguished by its high 
      potency, selectivity, long-half-life and its potential to be effectively combined 
      with other agents in RCC. This may offer more effective, yet well-tolerated 
      treatment options. The relative clinical and market relevance remain to be seen, 
      both for RCC therapy and other tumor types.

      renal cell carcinoma.
PG  - 416-24
LID - 10.1016/j.ctrv.2010.01.003 [doi]
AB  - The plethora of novel agents recently approved for the management of metastatic 
      renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has changed the therapeutic landscape in this disease. 
      The plethora of targets some of these agents inhibit can result in a wide range 
      of side effects. While these novel therapies can be viewed as inhibitors of 
      angiogenesis that directly or indirectly target the vascular endothelial growth 
      factor (VEGF) pathway, their individual mechanisms of action (MoA) are key to 
      defining their side-effect profiles. Direct VEGF inhibition with the anti-VEGF 
      monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, is primarily associated with side effects 
      related to the precise inhibition of VEGF, such as proteinuria, hypertension and 
      minor bleeding events. In contrast, non-VEGF-related side effects are observed 
      with agents inhibiting multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (sunitinib, sorafenib, 
      axitinib and pazopanib) and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors 
      (temsirolimus and everolimus); these include diarrhoea, skin rash, stomatitis, 
      hand-foot skin reaction, hypothyroidism, and haematological and metabolic 
      abnormalities. This review discusses the MoA of these novel therapies and how a 
      greater understanding of MoA may help to predict the range and type of side 
      effects, develop combinations of agents with acceptable tolerability, enable a 
      more rational approach to patient selection, and allow the development of 
      effective side-effect management strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Until recently, few treatments were available for renal cell 
      carcinoma (RCC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Several targeted 
      agents inhibiting key pathogenetic pathways have since been developed for RCC 
      (sunitinib, sorafenib, bevacizumab, temsirolimus, everolimus) and GIST (imatinib, 
      sunitinib). Sunitinib is a multi-kinase inhibitor of VEGFR-2, PDGFR (alpha,beta), 
      FLT-3, KIT, CSF-1 and RET. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the literature regarding the 
      structure, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, toxicity and current clinical use 
      of sunitinib. Other potential roles for this drug in RCC, GIST and other tumor 
      types will be discussed. METHODS: A literature search identified relevant 
      (pre)clinical studies of sunitinib and other relevant agents. 
      RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Sunitinib revolutionized the management of advanced RCC and 
      GIST. With the realization that cross-resistance between targeted agents is 
      incomplete, evolving strategies include sequential treatment, concurrent 
      treatment, and biomarker development. Sunitinib also shows promise in several 
      other tumor types that lack therapeutic options. What remains less clear is its 
      role in tumors that are not heavily dependent on a central pathogenetic pathway, 
      especially if effective cytotoxic therapies exist. Future clinical trials will 
      clarify whether there is a role for sunitinib in these tumors, possibly in 
      combination with cytotoxic agents.

AB  - A series of 6-phenylpurine based hydroxamates have been designed, synthesized and 
      evaluated. Compound 3b and its analogs are potent histone deacetylase (HDAC) but 
      weak PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. These compounds demonstrated broad anti-cancer 
      activities against 38 cancer cell lines with leukemia, lymphoma, and the majority 
      of liver cancer cell lines exhibiting the most sensitivity towards these 
      compounds. Compound 3b demonstrated modulation of HDAC targets in vitro in a 
      dose-dependent manner. It has good in vitro ADME profile that translated into a 
      greatly improved pharmacokinetic profile. 3b also demonstrated modulation of 
      HDACs in tumors in a PC-3 xenograft model. It was further evaluated in 
      combination therapies in vitro. It exhibited additive or synergistic growth 
      inhibition effect in HepG2 cells when combined with a number of approved drugs 
      such as sorafenib, sunitinib, and erlotinib. Hence, 3b has the potential to be 
      combined with the above to treat advanced liver cancer. As such, current data 
      warrant further evaluation, optimization, and subsequent in vivo validation of 
      the potential combination therapies.

      Agents.
PG  - e202100766
LID - 10.1002/cbdv.202100766 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a common malignancy worldwide, has a high 
      mortality rate and limited effective therapeutic options. In this work, a series 
      of quinazolinone compounds (6a-t and 7a-i) were synthesized as potential anti-HCC 
      agents. Among them, compound 7b more potently inhibited HepG2, HUH7 and SK-Hep-1 
      cells proliferation than classical anti-HCC drug sorafenib, indicating its 
      potential anti-HCC effect. Interestingly, 7b could dose-dependently decrease 
      Cyclin D1 and CDK2 levels, and increase p21 protein expression, thus inducing 
      HepG2 cells cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. In addition, 7b also displayed potent 
      apoptosis-induced effect on HepG2 cells by interfering Bad, Bax, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl 
      proteins expression. Notably, 7b could efficiently block the activity of PI3K 
      pathway by dose-dependently reducing the phosphorylation of PI3K (Y607) and AKT 
      (S473). Moreover, predicted ADME properties indicated that 7b possessed a good 
      pharmacokinetic profile. Collectively, compound 7b might be a promising lead to 
      the development of novel therapeutic agents towards HCC.

TI  - Cogent role of flavonoids as key orchestrators of chemoprevention of 
      hepatocellular carcinoma: A review.
PG  - e13761
LID - 10.1111/jfbc.13761 [doi]
AB  - Chemopreventive approaches with food-derived phytochemicals are progressively 
      rising as a significant aspect of tumor management and control. Herein, we have 
      showcased the major phytoconstituents belonging to the group of flavanoid, as 
      anti-cancer agents used for the treatment and prevention of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). Sorafenib is the sole drug used for the treatment of advanced 
      HCC, but its clinical application is limited because of its severe adverse 
      effects and drug resistance. Diet-based chemoprevention seems to be the way 
      forward for this disease of malignant nature. As HCC is derived from a chronic 
      inflammatory milieu, the regular incorporation of bioactive phytochemicals in the 
      diet will confer protection and prevent progression to hepatocarcinogenesis. Many 
      preclinical studies proved that the health benefits of flavonoids confer 
      cytotoxic potential against various types of cancers including hepatocellular 
      carcinoma. As flavonoids with excellent safety profile are abundantly present in 
      common vegetables and fruits, they can be better utilized for chemoprevention and 
      chemosensitization in such chronic condition. This review highlights the 
      plausible role of the eight most promising flavonoids (Curcumin, Kaempferol, 
      Resveratrol, Quercetin, Silibinin, Baicalein, Galangin and Luteolin) as key 
      orchestrators of chemoprevention in hepatocellular carcinoma with preclinical and 
      clinical evidence. An attempt to address the challenges in its clinical 
      translation is also included. This review also provides an insight into the close 
      association of HCC and metabolic disorders which may further decipher the 
      chemopreventive effect of dietary bioactive from a proof of concept to extensive 
      clinical translation. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: According to GLOBOCAN 2020 
      database, it is estimated that 905,677 new cases of liver cancer and 
      approximately 830,180 deaths related to that. The cancer incidence and mortality 
      are almost similar as it is diagnosed at an advanced stage in patients where 
      systemic drug therapy is the sole approach. Due to the emergence of multidrug 
      resistance and drug-related toxicities, most of the patient can not adhere to the 
      therapy regimen. Flavonoids are known to be a potential anticancer agent with an 
      excellent safety profile. These are found to be effective preclinically against 
      hepatocellular carcinoma through modulation of numerous pathways in 
      hepatocarcinogenesis. But, the bioavailability issue, lack of well 
      designed-validated clinical evidence, the possibility of food-drug interaction 
      etc limit its clinical utility. The research inputs mainly to overcome 
      pharmacokinetic issues along with suitable validation of efficacy and toxicity 
      will be a critical point for establishing flavonoids as an effective, safe, 
      affordable therapeutics.

AB  - PURPOSE: The diagnosis, staging, and management of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are 
      reviewed. The mechanism, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, clinical activity, and 
      application of molecularly targeted agents in RCC are emphasized. SUMMARY: RCC is 
      the eighth most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the United States. The most 
      common signs and symptoms are gross hematuria, flank pain, and the presence of a 
      flank mass. Localized disease is found in about 55% of patients, 19% of patients 
      have locally advanced disease, and 20% of patients have metastatic disease. 
      Surgical resection is the mainstay of therapy for stage I-III RCC. The 
      pharmacotherapy of RCC is undergoing significant change. Standard therapy used to 
      include the cytokines interferon alfa and aldesleukin. High-dose aldesleukin is 
      used to treat select patients. Its major value is the durability of responses in 
      the few patients who achieve a complete remission. However, cytokines have been 
      largely displaced by sorafenib tosylate, sunitinib malate, and temsirolimus due 
      to their lower rates of toxicity and positive effects on progression-free 
      survival. Bevacizumab has also shown activity in patients with advanced disease. 
      Estimated five-year survival rates for patients with RCC are 89.6% for localized 
      disease, 60.8% for regional disease, and 9.5% for patients with distant 
      metastases. Studies are currently under way to assess the activity of 
      combinations of available agents and new targeted agents as adjuvant therapy and 
      for the management of advanced RCC. CONCLUSION: The options available for the 
      management of advanced RCC have expanded considerably in the past five years with 
      the advent of molecularly targeted therapies.

TI  - Ocoxin as a complement to first line treatments in cancer.
PG  - 835-845

AB  - Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the most frequent treatment for patients 
      suffering from malignant progression of cancer. Even though new treatments are 
      now being implemented, administration of these chemotherapeutic agents remains as 
      the first line option in many tumor types. However, the secondary effects of 
      these compounds represent one of the main reasons cancer patients lose life 
      quality during disease progression. Recent data suggests that Ocoxin, a plant 
      extract and natural compound based nutritional complement rich in antioxidants 
      and anti-inflammatory mediators exerts a positive effect in patients receiving 
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This mixture attenuates the chemotherapy and 
      radiotherapy-related side effects such as radiation-induced skin burns and 
      mucositis, chemotherapy-related diarrhea, hepatic toxicity and blood-infection. 
      Moreover, it has been proven to be effective as anticancer agent in different 
      tumor models both in vitro and in vivo, potentiating the cytotoxic effect of 
      several chemotherapy compounds such as Lapatinib, Gemcitabine, Paclitaxel, 
      Sorafenib and Irinotecan. The aim of this review is to put some light on the 
      potential of this nutritional mixture as an anticancer agent and complement for 
      the standard chemotherapy routine.

TI  - Hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 16018
LID - 10.1038/nrdp.2016.18 [doi]
AB  - Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally and 
      has an incidence of approximately 850,000 new cases per year. Hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) represents approximately 90% of all cases of primary liver 
      cancer. The main risk factors for developing HCC are well known and include 
      hepatitis B and C virus infection, alcohol intake and ingestion of the fungal 
      metabolite aflatoxin B1. Additional risk factors such as non-alcoholic 
      steatohepatitis are also emerging. Advances in the understanding of the molecular 
      pathogenesis of HCC have led to identification of critical driver mutations; 
      however, the most prevalent of these are not yet druggable targets. The molecular 
      classification of HCC is not established, and the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer 
      staging classification is the main clinical algorithm for the stratification of 
      patients according to prognosis and treatment allocation. Surveillance programmes 
      enable the detection of early-stage tumours that are amenable to curative 
      therapies - resection, liver transplantation or local ablation. At more developed 
      stages, only chemoembolization (for intermediate HCC) and sorafenib (for advanced 
      HCC) have shown survival benefits. There are major unmet needs in HCC management 
      that might be addressed through the discovery of new therapies and their 
      combinations for use in the adjuvant setting and for intermediate- and 
      advanced-stage disease. Moreover, biomarkers for therapy stratification, 
      patient-tailored strategies targeting driver mutations and/or activating 
      signalling cascades, and validated measurements of quality of life are needed. 
      Recent failures in the testing of systemic drugs for intermediate and advanced 
      stages have indicated a need to refine trial designs and to define novel 
      approaches.

TI  - Pazopanib: an orally administered multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor for 
      locally advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
PG  - 5991-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer 
      in adults, responsible for approximately 90% of all kidney cancers. Prior to 
      2005, treatment options for patients with locally advanced and metastatic disease 
      were limited. After the approval of sorafenib by the US Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA), other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have been 
      successively used for treating patients with advanced RCC. Pazopanib is the 
      newest, orally bioavailable, and multi-targeted TKI, and is considered a 
      first-line treatment option for certain patients. This review summarizes updated 
      clinical studies, mechanism of action, and pharmacokinetics of pazopanib. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Published English language literatures and data 
      information on pazopanib for treating advanced RCC available as of March 2011 
      were identified and summarized. RESULTS: In phase II and III randomized clinical 
      trials, pazopanib treatment resulted in considerably longer progression-free 
      survival in patients with advanced RCC compared to placebo, with an acceptable 
      side-effect profile. In addition, there are a few ongoing pazopanib studies 
      including comparison to other TKIs, use for patients who have failed prior 
      cytokine therapy, and combination with other therapeutic agents. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Pazopanib has been used in the United States, Europe and Canada for treating 
      patients with advanced RCC. Currently, it is being used in good or intermediate 
      risk RCC and shows survival benefit with acceptable adverse effects. Pazopanib is 
      a new treatment option and needs further evaluation, particularly on its effect 
      relative to other TKIs as well as its use in combination with other agents.

TI  - Noncardiac vascular toxicities of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors 
      in advanced cancer: a review.
PG  - 432-44
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2010-0271 [doi]
AB  - The introduction of molecularly targeted anticancer therapies has brought the 
      promise of longer survival times for select patients with cancers previously 
      considered untreatable. However, it has also brought new toxicities that require 
      understanding and management, sometimes for long periods of time. Vascular 
      endothelial growth factor inhibitors are associated with a broad range of adverse 
      effects, with vascular toxicity being particularly serious. This review focuses 
      on the current understanding of the pathophysiology and mechanisms of 
      macrovascular toxicities (hypertension, hemorrhage, and thromboembolism), their 
      incidence and severity, the current clinical management, and implications in the 
      advanced cancer setting. Movement of these agents into the early disease setting 
      will alter the impact of these toxicities. Search Strategy and Selection 
      Criteria. Information for this review was collected by searching PubMed/Medline 
      and American Society of Clinical Oncology abstract databases. The medical subject 
      heading terms used included toxicity, hypertension, thromboembolism, hemorrhage, 
      intestinal perforation, risk factors, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism, combined 
      with free text search terms including, but not limited to, VEGF inhibitor*, 
      bevacizumab, sunitinib, and sorafenib. Articles published in English before March 
      2010 were included, in addition to information from case reports and 
      pharmaceutical agent package inserts.

TI  - Novel Antibody Exerts Antitumor Effect through Downregulation of CD147 and 
      Activation of Multiple Stress Signals.
PG  - 3552793
LID - 10.1155/2022/3552793 [doi]
LID - 3552793
AB  - CD147 is an immunoglobulin-like receptor that is highly expressed in various 
      cancers and involved in the growth, metastasis, and activation of inflammatory 
      pathways via interactions with various functional molecules, such as integrins, 
      CD44, and monocarboxylate transporters. Through screening of CD147-targeting 
      antibodies with antitumor efficacy, we discovered a novel rat monoclonal antibody 
      (#)147D. This humanized IgG4-formatted antibody, h4(#)147D, showed potent 
      antitumor efficacy in xenograft mouse models harboring the human PDAC cell line 
      MIA PaCa-2, HCC cell line Hep G2, and CML cell line KU812, which featured low 
      sensitivity to the corresponding standard-of-care drugs (gemcitabine, sorafenib, 
      and imatinib, respectively). An analysis of tumor cells derived from MIA PaCa-2 
      xenograft mice treated with h4(#)147D revealed that cell surface expression of 
      CD147 and its binding partners, including CD44 and integrin α3β1/α6β1, was 
      significantly reduced by h4(#)147D. Inhibition of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), 
      activation of multiple stress responsible signal proteins such as c-JunN-terminal 
      kinase (JNK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (p38MAPK), and expression 
      of SMAD4, as well as activation of caspase-3 were obviously observed in the tumor 
      cells, suggesting that h4(#)147D induced tumor shrinkage by inducing multiple 
      stress responsible signals. These results suggest that the anti-CD147 antibody 
      h4(#)147D offers promise as a new antibody drug candidate.

PG  - 164-72

AB  - Angiogenesis is a driving force of a tumor's development. Targeting this process 
      is an attractive option, as this is a feature shared by most of the solid tumors. 
      A lot of antiangiogenic drugs have been developed following this path, including 
      bevacizumab, sorafenib, sunitinib, vandetanib, ramucirumab, motesanib and many 
      others. The latest drug of this class to be approved for patients with non-small 
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was nintedanib, a triple angiokinase inhibitor. This 
      molecule targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet derived 
      growth factor (PDGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) pathways, avoiding the 
      tumor's switch to normal escape mechanisms. The pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic 
      and toxicity profiles of nintedanib have been tested in several studies. These 
      trials revealed it to be very interesting, as this agent did not lead to the 
      classical adverse events of other tyrosine kinase inhibitors. A phase III 
      clinical trial that recently concluded provided us with relevant information in 
      patients with NSCLC of adenocarcinoma histology. Here we present a short overview 
      of the tumor angiogenesis pathways and antiangiogenic drugs. In particular, we 
      will focus on nintedanib, from the preclinical studies to the latest phase III 
      clinical trial that allowed this new agent to be approved by the European 
      Medicines Agency as a second-line treatment option in association with docetaxel 
      for NSCLC patients with adenocarcinoma histology.

AB  - PURPOSE: The diagnosis, staging, and management of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are 
      reviewed. The mechanism, pharmacokinetics, toxicity, clinical activity, and 
      application of molecularly targeted agents in RCC are emphasized. SUMMARY: RCC is 
      the eighth most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the United States. The most 
      common signs and symptoms are gross hematuria, flank pain, and the presence of a 
      flank mass. Localized disease is found in about 55% of patients, 19% of patients 
      have locally advanced disease, and 20% of patients have metastatic disease. 
      Surgical resection is the mainstay of therapy for stage I-III RCC. The 
      pharmacotherapy of RCC is undergoing significant change. Standard therapy used to 
      include the cytokines interferon alfa and aldesleukin. High-dose aldesleukin is 
      used to treat select patients. Its major value is the durability of responses in 
      the few patients who achieve a complete remission. However, cytokines have been 
      largely displaced by sorafenib tosylate, sunitinib malate, and temsirolimus due 
      to their lower rates of toxicity and positive effects on progression-free 
      survival. Bevacizumab has also shown activity in patients with advanced disease. 
      Estimated five-year survival rates for patients with RCC are 89.6% for localized 
      disease, 60.8% for regional disease, and 9.5% for patients with distant 
      metastases. Studies are currently under way to assess the activity of 
      combinations of available agents and new targeted agents as adjuvant therapy and 
      for the management of advanced RCC. CONCLUSION: The options available for the 
      management of advanced RCC have expanded considerably in the past five years with 
      the advent of molecularly targeted therapies.

      with a kinase inhibitor using systems toxicology.

LID - 10.1038/npjsba.2015.5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Targeted kinase inhibitors are an important class of 
      agents in anticancer therapeutics, but their limited tolerability hampers their 
      clinical performance. Identification of the molecular mechanisms underlying the 
      development of adverse reactions will be helpful in establishing a rational 
      method for the management of clinically adverse reactions. Here, we selected 
      sunitinib as a model and demonstrated that the molecular mechanisms underlying 
      the adverse reactions associated with kinase inhibitors can efficiently be 
      identified using a systems toxicological approach. METHODS: First, toxicological 
      target candidates were short-listed by comparing the human kinase occupancy 
      profiles of sunitinib and sorafenib, and the molecular mechanisms underlying 
      adverse reactions were predicted by sequential simulations using publicly 
      available mathematical models. Next, to evaluate the probability of these 
      predictions, a clinical observation study was conducted in six patients treated 
      with sunitinib. Finally, mouse experiments were performed for detailed 
      confirmation of the hypothesized molecular mechanisms and to evaluate the 
      efficacy of a proposed countermeasure against adverse reactions to sunitinib. 
      RESULTS: In silico simulations indicated the possibility that sunitinib-mediated 
      off-target inhibition of phosphorylase kinase leads to the generation of 
      oxidative stress in various tissues. Clinical observations of patients and mouse 
      experiments confirmed the validity of this prediction. The simulation further 
      suggested that concomitant use of an antioxidant may prevent sunitinib-mediated 
      adverse reactions, which was confirmed in mouse experiments. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      systems toxicological approach successfully predicted the molecular mechanisms 
      underlying clinically adverse reactions associated with sunitinib and was used to 
      plan a rational method for the management of these adverse reactions.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Codrituzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against 
      Glypican-3 (GPC3) that is expressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), interacts 
      with CD16/FcγRIIIa and triggers antibody-dependent cytotoxicity. Codrituzumab was 
      studied vs. placebo in a randomized phase II trial in advanced HCC patients who 
      had failed prior systemic therapy. METHODS: Patients with advanced HCC who had 
      failed prior systemic therapy, ⩾18years, Eastern cooperative oncology group 
      (ECOG) 0-1, Child-Pugh A were randomized 2:1 to biweekly codrituzumab 1600mg vs. 
      placebo. Patients were stratified based on GPC3 immunohistochemical expression: 
      2+/3+, 1+, and 0. Primary endpoint was progression free survival. Secondary 
      endpoints include overall survival (OS), tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and an 
      exploratory endpoint in biomarkers analysis. RESULTS: 185 patients were enrolled: 
      125 received codrituzumab and 60 placebo: Median age 64/63, 85/75% male, 46/42% 
      Asian, ECOG 0 65/63%, 74/77% having vascular invasion and/or extra-hepatic 
      metastasis. 84%/70% had prior sorafenib. Drug exposure was 98.4% of planned dose, 
      with an identical adverse events profile between the 2 groups. The median 
      progression free survival and overall survival in the codrituzumab vs. placebo 
      groups in months were: 2.6 vs. 1.5 (hazard ratios 0.97, p=0.87), and 8.7 vs. 10 
      (hazard ratios 0.96, p=0.82). Projected Ctrough at cycle 3day 1 based exposure, 
      high CD16/FcγRIIIa on peripheral immune cells, and GPC3 expression in the tumor, 
      were all associated with prolonged progression free survival and overall 
      survival. CONCLUSIONS: Codrituzumab did not show clinical benefit in this 
      previously treated HCC population. Whether higher codrituzumab drug exposure or 
      the use of CD16 and GPC3 as potential biomarkers would improve outcome remain 
      unanswered questions. LAY SUMMARY: Codrituzumab is a manufactured antibody 
      against a liver cancer protein called glypican-3. In this clinical trial, 
      codrituzumab was not found be effective against liver cancer. It was suggested 
      though that a higher dose of codrituzumab or selecting patients with high level 
      of glypican-3 or its mediator CD16 might improve outcome. CLINICAL TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: This trial is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01507168).

TI  - MTL-CEBPA, a Small Activating RNA Therapeutic Upregulating C/EBP-α, in Patients 
      with Advanced Liver Cancer: A First-in-Human, Multicenter, Open-Label, Phase I 
      Trial.
PG  - 3936-3946
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-20-0414 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Transcription factor C/EBP-α (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha) acts 
      as a master regulator of hepatic and myeloid functions and multiple oncogenic 
      processes. MTL-CEBPA is a first-in-class small activating RNA oligonucleotide 
      drug that upregulates C/EBP-α. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a phase I, 
      open-label, dose-escalation trial of MTL-CEBPA in adults with advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with cirrhosis, or resulting from nonalcoholic 
      steatohepatitis or with liver metastases. Patients received intravenous MTL-CEBPA 
      once a week for 3 weeks followed by a rest period of 1 week per treatment cycle 
      in the dose-escalation phase (3+3 design). RESULTS: Thirty-eight participants 
      have been treated across six dose levels (28-160 mg/m(2)) and three dosing 
      schedules. Thirty-four patients were evaluable for safety endpoints at 28 days. 
      MTL-CEBPA treatment-related adverse events were not associated with dose, and no 
      maximum dose was reached across the three schedules evaluated. Grade 3 
      treatment-related adverse events occurred in nine (24%) patients. In 24 patients 
      with HCC evaluable for efficacy, an objective tumor response was achieved in one 
      patient [4%; partial response (PR) for over 2 years] and stable disease (SD) in 
      12 (50%). After discontinuation of MTL-CEBPA, seven patients were treated with 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs); three patients had a complete response with 
      one further PR and two with SD. CONCLUSIONS: MTL-CEBPA is the first saRNA in 
      clinical trials and demonstrates an acceptable safety profile and potential 
      synergistic efficacy with TKIs in HCC. These encouraging phase I data validate 
      targeting of C/EBP-α and have prompted MTL-CEBPA + sorafenib combination studies 
      in HCC.
