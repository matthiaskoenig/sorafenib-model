TI  - No Effect of Levothyroxine and Levothyroxine-Induced Subclinical Thyrotoxicosis 
      on the Pharmacokinetics of Sorafenib in Healthy Male Subjects.
PG  - 1118-1127
LID - 10.1089/thy.2017.0085 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients receiving the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib for locally 
      recurrent or metastatic, progressive, differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) 
      refractory to radioactive iodine often receive concomitant levothyroxine for 
      thyrotropin (TSH) suppression. In the Phase 3 DTC trial (DECISION), sorafenib 
      exposure was approximately twofold higher than that observed in other cancers. 
      This study assessed sorafenib pharmacokinetics without and with concomitant 
      levothyroxine to examine whether a levothyroxine interaction or 
      levothyroxine-induced subclinical thyrotoxicosis results in increased sorafenib 
      exposure in patients with DTC. METHODS: This was an open-label, two-period 
      sequential treatment study in healthy male subjects. In period 1, day 1, subjects 
      received a single oral dose of sorafenib 400 mg, followed by a minimal 10-day 
      washout. In period 2, day 1, levothyroxine 300 μg was administered orally once 
      daily (q.d.) for 14 days. After 10 days, a single oral concomitant dose of 
      sorafenib 400 mg was given. Blood samples for sorafenib pharmacokinetic analyses 
      were obtained pre-dose and at time points up to 96 hours after sorafenib dosing. 
      Samples for thyroid tests were collected before and after levothyroxine dosing. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-five subjects completed the study and were evaluable for 
      pharmacokinetic analysis. Levothyroxine 300 μg q.d. was well tolerated and 
      induced subclinical thyrotoxicosis, producing full suppression of TSH 
      (M ± SD = 0.032 ± 0.027 mIU/L) and increased free thyroxine (from 0.94 ± 0.09 to 
      1.77 ± 0.33 ng/dL) and free triiodothyronine (from 2.87 ± 0.28 to 
      4.24 ± 0.66 pg/mL) levels by day 11 of period 2. The geometric mean (%CV) 
      sorafenib maximum concentration (C(max)) without and with levothyroxine was 2.09 
      (68.1) and 1.78 (63.9) mg/L, respectively, with a corresponding geometric mean 
      area under the curve of 68.1 (68.2) and 64.3 (66.3) mg·h/L. Median (range) time 
      to C(max) was 4.00 (2.98-16.0) and 4.02 (1.98-36.0) hours, respectively. Mean 
      (%CV) half-life was 24.0 (25.3) and 25.7 (21.0) hours. All study drug-related 
      adverse events were mild and included headache and fatigue for sorafenib, and 
      headache, increased alanine aminotransferase and glutamate dehydrogenase, 
      fatigue, and nervousness for levothyroxine. CONCLUSIONS: Levothyroxine 300 μg 
      q.d. for 14 days was well tolerated, induced subclinical thyrotoxicosis, and did 
      not affect sorafenib pharmacokinetics. The findings suggest that concomitant use 
      of levothyroxine with sorafenib is not likely responsible for the previously 
      reported increase in sorafenib exposure in patients with DTC. However, the 
      possible effects of long-term levothyroxine dosing were not assessed.

TI  - Phase I trial to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of 
      sorafenib combined with docetaxel in patients with advanced refractory solid 
      tumours.
PG  - 465-74
LID - 10.1016/j.ejca.2011.12.026 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of sorafenib plus docetaxel in 
      patients with advanced refractory cancer were investigated in a phase I, 
      dose-escalation trial. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients in four cohorts received 
      docetaxel on day 1 (cohorts 1 and 4: 75 mg/m2; cohorts 2 and 3: 100 mg/m2) plus 
      sorafenib on days 2-19 (cohorts 1 and 2: 200 mg twice-daily (bid); cohorts 3 and 
      4: 400 mg bid) in 21-day cycles. RESULTS: Most common adverse events (AEs) (grade 
      3-5) included neutropenia (89%), leucopaenia (81%), hand-foot skin reaction (30%) 
      and fatigue (30%). The most common drug-related AEs leading to dose 
      reduction/interruption or permanent discontinuation were dermatologic (41%), 
      gastrointestinal (26%) and constitutional (22%). Coadministration of sorafenib 
      altered the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. On average, docetaxel area under the 
      concentration-time curve (AUC)(0-24) increased by 5% (cohort 1), 54% (cohort 2), 
      36% (Cohort 3) and 80% (cohort 4) with docetaxel plus sorafenib, while C(max) 
      increased by 16-32%, independent of sorafenib/docetaxel doses. Three of 25 
      evaluable patients (11%) had partial responses; 14 (52%) had stable disease. 
      CONCLUSION: Dose-limiting dermatologic AEs were more common than expected for 
      either therapy alone. A starting dose of docetaxel 75 mg/m2 plus sorafenib 400mg 
      bid (with dose reductions for dermatological toxicities) is proposed for phase 
      II.

TI  - Influence of Probenecid on the Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of 
      Sorafenib.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics12090788 [doi]
LID - 788
AB  - Prior studies have demonstrated an organic anion transporter 6 (OAT6)-mediated 
      accumulation of sorafenib in keratinocytes. The OAT6 inhibitor probenecid 
      decreases sorafenib uptake in skin and might, therefore, decrease 
      sorafenib-induced cutaneous adverse events. Here, the influence of probenecid on 
      sorafenib pharmacokinetics and toxicity was investigated. Pharmacokinetic 
      sampling was performed in 16 patients on steady-state sorafenib treatment at days 
      1 and 15 of the study. Patients received sorafenib (200-800 mg daily) in 
      combination with probenecid (500 mg two times daily (b.i.d.)) on days 2-15. This 
      study was designed to determine bioequivalence with geometric mean Area under the 
      curve from zero to twelve hours (AUC(0-12 h)) as primary endpoint. During 
      concomitant probenecid, sorafenib plasma AUC(0-12 h) decreased by 27% (90% CI: 
      -38% to -14%; P < 0.01). Furthermore, peak and trough levels of sorafenib, as 
      well as sorafenib concentrations in skin, decreased to a similar extent in the 
      presence of probenecid. The metabolic ratio of sorafenib-glucuronide to parent 
      drug increased (+29%) in the presence of probenecid. A decrease in systemic 
      sorafenib concentrations during probenecid administration seems to have 
      influenced cutaneous concentrations. Since sorafenib-glucuronide concentrations 
      increased compared with sorafenib and sorafenib-N-oxide, probenecid may have 
      interrupted enterohepatic circulation of sorafenib by inhibition of the organic 
      anion transporting polypeptides 1B1 (OATP1B1). Sorafenib treatment with 
      probenecid is, therefore, not bioequivalent to sorafenib monotherapy. A clear 
      effect of probenecid on sorafenib toxicity could not be identified in this study.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the safety and tolerability of the small-molecule allosteric 
      MEK inhibitor refametinib combined with sorafenib, in patients with advanced 
      solid malignancies. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: This phase I dose-escalation study 
      included an expansion phase at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Patients 
      received refametinib/sorafenib twice daily for 28 days, from a dose of 
      refametinib 5 mg plus sorafenib 200 mg to a dose of refametinib 50 mg plus 
      sorafenib 400 mg. Plasma levels of refametinib, refametinib metabolite M17, and 
      sorafenib were measured for pharmacokinetic assessments. Tumors were biopsied at 
      the MTD for analysis of MEK pathway mutations and ERK phosphorylation. RESULTS: 
      Thirty-two patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation cohort. The MTD was 
      refametinib 50 mg twice daily plus sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. The most common 
      treatment-related toxicities were diarrhea and fatigue. Refametinib was readily 
      absorbed following oral administration (plasma half-life of ∼16 hours at the 
      MTD), and pharmacokinetic parameters displayed near-dose proportionality, with 
      less than 2-fold accumulation after multiple dosing. Another 30 patients were 
      enrolled in the MTD cohort; 19 had hepatocellular carcinoma. The combination was 
      associated with significantly reduced ERK phosphorylation in 5 out of 6 patients 
      biopsied, with the greatest reductions in those with KRAS or BRAF mutations. 
      Disease was stabilized in approximately half of patients, and 1 patient with 
      colorectal cancer achieved a partial response at the MTD lasting approximately 1 
      year. CONCLUSIONS: In this phase I study, refametinib plus sorafenib was well 
      tolerated, with good oral absorption, near-dose proportionality, and target 
      inhibition in a range of tumor types. Clin Cancer Res; 22(10); 2368-76. ©2015

TI  - Phase II study to investigate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of 
      sorafenib in Japanese patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma.
PG  - 755-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sorafenib (Nexavar) is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor that targets 
      tumor growth and angiogenesis. This phase II study investigated efficacy, safety, 
      and pharmacokinetics of sorafenib in Japanese patients with advanced renal cell 
      carcinoma (RCC). METHODS: Nonrandomized, open-label study in Japanese patients 
      with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who had received nephrectomy and failed >/=1 
      cytokine-containing therapy. The primary endpoint was response rate. Patients 
      received sorafenib 400 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) on a continuous dosing schedule. 
      RESULTS: A total of 129 patients (median age 63 years) were valid for 
      intention-to-treat analyses. Confirmed partial responses were observed in 16 
      (12.4%) patients, and investigators assessed that 19 (14.7%) of the patients 
      achieved a partial response. Stable disease was reported in 93 (72.1%) patients, 
      and 103 (80.5%) patients had tumor shrinkage. Median progression-free survival 
      was 224 days and the 25th percentile of overall survival was estimated at 288 
      days. The most frequently occurring drug-related adverse events (any grade) were 
      elevated lipase (56%), hand-foot skin reaction (55%), alopecia (39%), increased 
      amylase (38%), rash/desquamation (37%), and diarrhea (34%). A total of 14 (10.7%) 
      patients had serious sorafenib-related adverse events, including one adverse 
      event of worst grade 5 (dyspnea occurred 35 days after the last dose of study 
      medication). The C(trough,steady state) values in RCC patients (n = 63) receiving 
      sorafenib 400 mg b.i.d. were similar to those obtained from a Japanese phase I 
      study involving patients with mixed solid tumors. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib showed 
      encouraging efficacy and was well tolerated in Japanese patients with metastatic 
      RCC.

TI  - A multicentre, open-label, phase-I/randomised phase-II study to evaluate safety, 
      pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of nintedanib vs. sorafenib in European patients 
      with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 1162-1168
LID - 10.1038/s41416-018-0051-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This multicentre, open-label, phase-I/randomised phase-II trial 
      evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics, maximum-tolerated-dose (MTD) per 
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and efficacy of nintedanib vs. sorafenib in 
      European patients with unresectable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (aHCC). 
      METHODS: Phase I: Patients were stratified into two groups per baseline 
      aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase and Child-Pugh score; MTD was 
      determined. Phase II: Patients were randomised 2:1 to nintedanib (MTD) or 
      sorafenib (400-mg bid) in 28-day cycles until intolerance or disease progression. 
      Time-to-progression (TTP, primary endpoint), overall survival (OS) and 
      progression-free survival (PFS) were determined. RESULTS: Phase-I: no DLTs 
      observed; nintedanib MTD in both groups was 200 mg bid. Phase-II: patients 
      (N = 93) were randomised to nintedanib (n = 62) or sorafenib (n = 31); TTP was 
      5.5 vs. 4.6 months (HR = 1.44 [95% CI, 0.81-2.57]), OS was 11.9 vs. 11.4 months 
      (HR = 0.88 [95% CI, 0.52-1.47]), PFS was 5.3 vs. 3.9 months (HR = 1.35 [95% CI, 
      0.78-2.34]), respectively (all medians). Dose intensity and tolerability favoured 
      nintedanib. Fewer patients on nintedanib (87.1%) vs. sorafenib (96.8%) had 
      drug-related adverse events (AEs) or grade ≥ 3 AEs (67.7% vs. 90.3%), but more 
      patients on nintedanib (28 [45.2%]) had AEs leading to drug discontinuation than 
      did those on sorafenib (7 [22.6%]). CONCLUSIONS: Nintedanib may have similar 
      efficacy to sorafenib in aHCC.

TI  - Phase I and pharmacokinetic study of sorafenib in patients with hepatic or renal 
      dysfunction: CALGB 60301.
PG  - 1800-5
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2008.20.0931 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We sought to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and determine a 
      tolerable dose of oral sorafenib in patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were assigned to one of nine cohorts: cohort 1, 
      bilirubin < or = upper limit of normal (ULN) and AST < or = ULN and creatinine 
      clearance (CC) > or = 60 mL/min; cohort 2, bilirubin more than ULN but < or = 
      1.5x ULN and/or AST more than ULN; cohort 3, CC between 40 and 59 mL/min; cohort 
      4, bilirubin more than 1.5x ULN to < or = 3x ULN (any AST); cohort 5, CC between 
      20 and 39 mL/min; cohort 6, bilirubin more than 3x ULN to 10x ULN (any AST); 
      cohort 7, CC less than 20 mL/min; cohort 8, albumin less than 2.5 mg/dL (any 
      bilirubin/AST); and cohort 9, hemodialysis. Sorafenib was administered as a 
      400-mg dose on day 1 for PK, and continuous daily dosing started on day 8. 
      RESULTS: Of 150 registered patients, 138 patients were treated. With the 
      exception of cohorts 6 and 7, at least 12 patients per cohort were assessable, 
      and the dose level with prospectively defined dose-limiting toxicity in less than 
      one third of patients by day 29 was considered tolerable. No significant 
      associations between the sorafenib PK and cohort were found. CONCLUSION: We 
      recommend the following empiric sorafenib starting doses by cohort: cohort 1, 400 
      mg twice a day; cohort 2, 400 mg twice a day; cohort 3, 400 mg twice a day; 
      cohort 4, 200 mg twice a day; cohort 5, 200 mg twice a day; cohort 6, not even 
      200 mg every third day tolerable; cohort 7, not defined; cohort 8, 200 mg each 
      day; and cohort 9, 200 mg each day.

TI  - Phase I study to determine the safety and pharmacokinetics of the novel Raf 
      kinase and VEGFR inhibitor BAY 43-9006, administered for 28 days on/7 days off in 
      patients with advanced, refractory solid tumors.
PG  - 1688-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: BAY 43--9006, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor, targets 
      serine-threonine kinases and receptor tyrosine kinases, and affects the tumor and 
      vasculature in preclinical models. Based on its pharmacologic effect, it may be a 
      useful cancer treatment. This study determined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) 
      of BAY 43-9006 in 42 patients with advanced, refractory metastatic or recurrent 
      solid tumors. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), safety, pharmacokinetics and tumor 
      response were also evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label, phase I, 
      dose-escalation study, BAY 43--9,006 was administered orally in repeated cycles 
      of 35 days (28 days on/7 days off). Eight doses were investigated: from 50 mg 
      every fourth day to 600 mg twice daily. Treatment continued until unacceptable 
      toxicity, tumor progression or death. RESULTS: The MTD was 400 mg twice daily. 
      BAY 43-9006 was well tolerated, with mild to moderate toxicities; only six 
      patients discontinued study therapy due to adverse events. DLTs consisted of 
      hand-foot skin reaction in three of seven patients receiving 600 mg twice daily. 
      Stable disease was achieved in 22% of patients; median duration of stable disease 
      was 7.2 months. Consistent with its observed half-life of approximately 27 h, BAY 
      43-9, 006 accumulated on multiple dosing. Increases in exposure were less than 
      proportional to the increases in dose. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that further 
      clinical investigation of BAY 43--9006 is warranted, and suggest it could be a 
      promising future therapy for patients with cancer.

TI  - The plasma and cerebrospinal fluid pharmacokinetics of sorafenib after 
      intravenous administration in non-human primates.
PG  - 524-8
LID - 10.1007/s10637-010-9585-1 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib is a small molecule inhibitor of multiple signaling kinases 
      thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of many tumors including brain tumors. 
      Clinical trials with sorafenib in primary and metastatic brain tumors are 
      ongoing. We evaluated the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pharmacokinetics 
      (PK) of sorafenib after an intravenous (IV) dose in a non-human primate (NHP) 
      model. METHODS: 7.3 mg/kg of sorafenib free base equivalent solubilized in 20% 
      cyclodextrin was administered IV over 1 h to three adult rhesus monkeys. Serial 
      paired plasma and CSF samples were collected over 24 h. Sorafenib was quantified 
      with a validated HPLC/tandem mass spectrometry assay. PK parameters were 
      estimated using non-compartmental methods. CSF penetration was calculated from 
      the AUC(CSF) : AUC(plasma). RESULTS: Peak plasma concentrations after IV dosing 
      ranged from 3.4 to 7.6 μg/mL. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) area under the 
      plasma concentration from 0 to 24 h was 28 ± 4.3 μg • h/mL, which is comparable 
      to the exposure observed in humans at recommended doses. The mean ± SD clearance 
      was 1.7 ± 0.5 mL/min/kg. The peak CSF concentrations ranged from 0.00045 to 
      0.00058 μg/mL. The mean ± SD area under the CSF concentration from 0 to 24h was 
      0.0048 ± 0.0016 μg•h/mL. The mean CSF penetration of sorafenib was 0.02% and 3.4% 
      after correcting for plasma protein binding. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib is well 
      tolerated in NHP and measurable in CSF after an IV dose. The CSF penetration of 
      sorafenib is limited relative to total and free drug exposure in plasma.

TI  - Temsirolimus combined with sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma: a phase I 
      dose-finding trial with pharmacokinetic and biomarker correlates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Based upon preclinical evidence for improved antitumor activity in 
      combination, this phase I study investigated the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), 
      safety, activity, pharmacokinetics (PK), and biomarkers of the mammalian target 
      of rapamycin inhibitor, temsirolimus, combined with sorafenib in hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with incurable HCC and Child Pugh 
      score ≤B7 were treated with sorafenib plus temsirolimus by 3 + 3 design. The 
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) interval was 28 days. The response was assessed 
      every two cycles. PK of temsirolimus was measured in a cohort at MTD. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-five patients were enrolled. The MTD was temsirolimus 10 mg weekly plus 
      sorafenib 200 mg twice daily. Among 18 patients at MTD, DLT included grade 3 
      hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) and grade 3 thrombocytopenia. Grade 3 or 4 related 
      adverse events at MTD included hypophosphatemia (33%), infection (22%), 
      thrombocytopenia (17%), HFSR (11%), and fatigue (11%). With sorafenib, 
      temsirolimus clearance was more rapid (P < 0.05). Two patients (8%) had a 
      confirmed partial response (PR); 15 (60%) had stable disease (SD). 
      Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) declined ≥50% in 60% assessable patients. CONCLUSION: The 
      MTD of sorafenib plus temsirolimus in HCC was lower than in other tumor types. 
      HCC-specific phase I studies are necessary. The observed efficacy warrants 
      further study.

TI  - Phase I safety and pharmacokinetics of BAY 43-9006 administered for 21 days on/7 
      days off in patients with advanced, refractory solid tumours.
PG  - 1855-61
AB  - BAY 43-9006 is a novel dual-action Raf kinase and vascular endothelial growth 
      factor receptor (VEGFR) inhibitor that targets tumour cell proliferation and 
      tumour angiogenesis. This Phase I study was undertaken to determine the safety 
      profile, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), 
      pharmacokinetics, and tumour response profile of oral BAY 43-9006 in patients 
      with advanced, refractory solid tumours. BAY 43-9006 was administered daily for 
      repeated cycles of 21 days on/7 days off. A total of 44 patients were enrolled at 
      doses from 50 to 800 mg b.i.d. Pharmacokinetic profiles of BAY 43-9006 in plasma 
      were determined during the first treatment cycle. The most frequently reported 
      adverse events over multiple cycles were gastrointestinal (75%), dermatologic 
      (71%), constitutional (68%), pain (64%), or hepatic (61%) related. A MTD of 400 
      mg b.i.d. BAY 43-9006 was defined. BAY 43-9006 was absorbed rapidly; steady-state 
      conditions were reached within 7 days. BAY 43-9006 exposure increased 
      nonproportionally with increasing dose. In all, 32 patients were evaluated for 
      tumour response: 15 patients showed tumour progression, 16 patients experienced 
      stable disease (>6 months in eight patients), and one patient with renal cell 
      carcinoma achieved a partial response. BAY 43-9006 given for 21 days with 7 days 
      off treatment was safe, well tolerated, and showed antitumour activity.

AB  - A c-Met inhibitor tivantinib is a candidate anticancer agent for patients with 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and CYP2C19 is the key metabolic enzyme for 
      tivantinib. Previous Japanese phase I studies in patients with solid tumors 
      (except HCC) recommend 360 mg twice daily (BID) and 240 mg BID for CYP2C19 
      extensive metabolizers (EM) and poor metabolizers (PM), respectively. In this 
      study, Japanese patients with HCC in whom sorafenib treatment has failed were 
      enrolled to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of oral 
      tivantinib as a single agent. The dose was escalated separately in EM and PM, 
      from 120 mg BID to 240 mg BID, in both capsule and tablet formulations. A total 
      of 28 patients (EM: 21, PM: 7) received tivantinib. At a dose of 120 mg BID, 
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) did not develop in 12 EM (capsule: 6, tablet: 6) 
      and 7 PM (capsule: 4, tablet: 3) during the DLT-observation period (for 29 days 
      after first dosing). At this dose, the pharmacokinetic profiles of tivantinib 
      (AUC0-12 and Cmax ) did not remarkably differ between EM and PM. When treated 
      with 240 mg BID, 5 of 9 EM (capsule: 4 of 6, tablet: 1 of 3) developed 
      neutropenia-related DLT accompanying plasma tivantinib concentration higher than 
      expected from the previous studies. Consequently, PM did not receive 240 mg BID. 
      In conclusion, 120 mg BID of tivantinib is recommended among Japanese patients 
      with HCC regardless of CYP2C19 phenotype.

TI  - The effects of triptolide on the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib in rats and its 
      potential mechanism.
PG  - 1863-1867

AB  - CONTEXT: Combining sorafenib with triptolide could inhibit tumour growth with 
      greater efficacy than single-agent treatment. However, their herb-drug 
      interaction remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the herb-drug 
      interaction between triptolide and sorafenib. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects 
      of triptolide (10 mg/kg) on the pharmacokinetics of different doses of sorafenib 
      (20, 50 and 100 mg/kg) in rats, and blood samples were collected within 48 h and 
      evaluated using LC-MS/MS. The effects of triptolide on the absorption and 
      metabolism of sorafenib were also investigated using Caco-2 cell monolayer model 
      and rat liver microsome incubation systems. RESULTS: The results showed that the 
      C(max) (low dose: 72.38 ± 8.76 versus 49.15 ± 5.46 ng/mL; medium dose: 
      178.65 ± 21.05 versus 109.31 ± 14.17 ng/mL; high dose: 332.81 ± 29.38 versus 
      230.86 ± 9.68 ng/mL) of sorafenib at different doses increased significantly with 
      the pretreatment of triptolide, and while the oral clearance rate of sorafenib 
      decreased. The t(1/2) of sorafenib increased significant (p < 0.05) from 
      9.02 ± 1.16 to 12.17 ± 2.95 h at low dose with the pretreatment of triptolide. 
      Triptolide has little effect on the absorption of sorafenib in Caco-2 cell 
      transwell model. However, triptolide could significantly decrease the intrinsic 
      clearance rate of sorafenib from 51.7 ± 6.37 to 32.4 ± 4.43 μL/min/mg protein in 
      rat liver microsomes. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that 
      triptolide could change the pharmacokinetic profiles of sorafenib in rats; these 
      effects might be exerted via decreasing the intrinsic clearance rate of sorafenib 
      in rat liver.

TI  - Safety and pharmacokinetics of sorafenib combined with capecitabine in patients

PG  - 1674-84
LID - 10.1177/0091270010386226 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib (twice daily [bid]) plus capecitabine (2 weeks on schedule/1 week off 
      schedule) safety and pharmacokinetics were investigated in patients with advanced 
      solid tumors (N = 35). Cohort 1 (n = 13) included sorafenib 200 mg bid and 
      capecitabine 1050 mg/m(2) bid; cohort 2 (n = 4), sorafenib 400 mg bid and 
      capecitabine 1050 mg/m(2) bid; cohort 3 (n = 6), sorafenib 200 mg bid and 
      capecitabine 1050 mg/m(2) bid (cycles 1 and 2), then 400 mg bid and capecitabine 
      1050 mg/m(2) bid (cycle 3 onwards); and cohort 4 (n = 12), sorafenib 400 mg bid 
      and capecitabine 850 mg/m(2) bid. The combination of sorafenib and capecitabine 
      was generally well tolerated. Most frequent drug-related adverse events were 
      hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR, 89%), diarrhea (71%), and fatigue (69%). The HFSR 
      was dose-limiting toxicities in 6 patients. Sorafenib exposure (C(max) and 
      AUC(0-12)) was unaffected by concomitant capecitabine. Concomitant sorafenib 
      moderately increased capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil (metabolite) exposure when 
      the capecitabine dose was 1050 mg/m(2) bid. Simultaneous administration of 400 mg 
      bid sorafenib and 850 mg/m(2) bid capecitabine, however, had only minor effects 
      on the exposure to capecitabine and 5-fluorouracil. Based on the overall toxicity 
      profile and pharmacokinetic parameters, the recommended phase 2 doses were 
      therefore sorafenib 400 mg bid and capecitabine 850 mg/m(2) bid, as scheduled 
      above.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic results of a phase I trial of sorafenib in combination with 
      dacarbazine in patients with advanced solid tumors.
PG  - 53-61
LID - 10.1007/s00280-010-1423-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor of Raf and several growth factor 
      receptors, is under investigation in combination with dacarbazine, a commonly 
      used chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of many cancers. The current phase 
      I study investigates the effects of sorafenib on the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile 
      of dacarbazine and its metabolite 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC). (AIC is 
      formed in amounts equimolar to the active alkylating moiety, methane 
      diazohydroxide, which is undetectable by known validated assays.) METHODS: 
      Patients with advanced solid tumors received intravenous dacarbazine 
      1,000 mg/m(2) on day 1 of a 21-day cycle to evaluate the PK of dacarbazine alone. 
      Sorafenib 400 mg was administered twice daily continuously starting at day 2 of 
      cycle 1. The PK of dacarbazine in the presence of sorafenib was assessed on day 1 
      of cycle 2. Sorafenib PK was also assessed at steady state. RESULTS: PK data were 
      available for 15 of 23 patients. With concomitant administration of sorafenib, 
      the mean AUC and C (max) values of dacarbazine were reduced by 23 and 16%, 
      respectively. Mean AUC and C (max) values of AIC were increased by 41 and 45%, 
      respectively, with individual increases of up to 106 and 136%, respectively. The 
      apparent terminal half-lives of the two compounds were not significantly 
      influenced by sorafenib. Based on coefficients of variation, the AUC and C (max) 
      values for sorafenib and its three metabolites were highly variable with 
      dacarbazine coadministration. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant administration of 
      sorafenib and dacarbazine as described above may result in decreased dacarbazine 
      exposure but increased AIC exposure.

      dose (MTD), safety profile, pharmacokinetic variables, effect on biomarkers, and 
      tumor response with BAY 43-9006 in 19 patients with advanced, refractory solid 
      tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: BAY 43-9006 was given orally in repeated cycles of 
      1-week on/1-week off. The study comprised five dose levels, ranging from 100 mg 
      twice daily (bid) to 800 mg bid. Treatment of each patient continued until 
      unacceptable toxicity, tumor progression, or death. RESULTS: Rash and 
      hypertension were the dose-limiting toxicities at the 800 mg bid dose requiring 
      study drug discontinuation; therefore, the MTD of BAY 43-9006 in this study was 
      determined to be 600 mg bid. BAY 43-9006 was generally well tolerated, with mild 
      to moderate toxicities. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed early absorption followed 
      by delayed secondary peaks and slow terminal elimination. Stable disease was 
      achieved in five patients: one patient showed reduced tumor activity (positron 
      emission tomography scan) and reduced mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling 
      (lower phospho-ERK); one patient remained on treatment until study end point. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the favorable safety profile of BAY 43-9006 and 
      support the development of this compound for the treatment of solid tumors.

TI  - Interaction of sorafenib and cytochrome P450 isoenzymes in patients with advanced 
      melanoma: a phase I/II pharmacokinetic interaction study.
PG  - 1111-8
LID - 10.1007/s00280-011-1585-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In vitro data indicate that the sorafenib is a moderate inhibitor of 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, including CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. This phase 
      I/II study in patients with advanced melanoma evaluated the potential effect of 
      sorafenib on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, omeprazole, and dextromethorphan, 
      specific substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6, respectively. METHODS: 
      Twenty-one patients received sorafenib 400 mg twice daily for 28 consecutive 
      days. On days 1 and 28, a cocktail containing midazolam 2 mg, omeprazole 20 mg, 
      and dextromethorphan 30 mg was administered. Pharmacokinetic analyses were 
      performed on day 1 without sorafenib and day 28 after steady-state sorafenib 
      exposure; sorafenib pharmacokinetics were evaluated on day 28. We defined an 
      interaction to be excluded if the 90% confidence interval of the ratio of all day 
      28:day 1 analyses fell within a range from 0.80 to 1.25. RESULTS: In all, 18 
      patients were evaluable. On day 28, area under the plasma concentration-time 
      curve from time 0 to 12 h (AUC(0-12)) and maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) 
      for sorafenib were 38.1 mg h/l and 4.9 mg/l, respectively. Day 28:day 1 ratios 
      for AUC from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-inf)) and C(max) for 
      midazolam were 0.85 and 0.98, respectively. Day 28:day 1 ratio for 
      5-OH-omeprazole:omeprazole plasma concentration at 3 h postdose was 1.26, 
      slightly outside of the 0.80-1.25 range. Thus, an interaction could not be 
      excluded, but is considered unlikely to be clinically significant. Day 28:day 1 
      ratio for dextromethorphan:dextrorphan concentration in urine was 0.94. Sorafenib 
      had an acceptable safety profile. The most frequently observed grade 3-4 
      toxicities in cycle 1 included elevated lipase (19%) and hypertension (10%). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this patient population, our results demonstrate that exposures 
      of probes of CYP3A4, CYP2D6, or CYP2C19 activity are potentially altered by 
      administration of sorafenib at 400 mg twice daily. However, these differences are 
      sufficiently small that a clinically significant inhibition or induction of these 
      important drug metabolizing P450 isoenzymes is unlikely. Clinical and, where 
      possible, drug level monitoring may still be appropriate for drugs of narrow 
      therapeutic range co-administered with sorafenib.

TI  - A phase I trial and pharmacokinetic study of sorafenib in children with 
      refractory solid tumors or leukemias: a Children's Oncology Group Phase I 
      Consortium report.
PG  - 6011-22
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-3284 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), maximum tolerated dose 
      (MTD), pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of sorafenib in children with 
      refractory extracranial solid tumors and evaluate the tolerability of the solid 
      tumor MTD in children with refractory leukemias. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Sorafenib 
      was administered orally every 12 hours for consecutive 28-day cycles. 
      Pharmacokinetics (day 1 and steady-state) and pharmacodynamics were conducted 
      during cycle 1. RESULTS: Of 65 patients enrolled, 60 were eligible. In the solid 
      tumor cohort (n = 49), 4 of 6 patients experienced a DLT [hypertension, pain, 
      rash/urticaria, thrombocytopenia, alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate 
      aminotransferase (AST)] at the starting dose (150 mg/m(2)/dose) which resulted in 
      de-escalation to 105 mg/m(2)/dose. After eligibility criteria modification and 
      dose re-escalation, the MTD was 200 mg/m(2)/dose for solid tumors and 150 
      mg/m(2)/dose for leukemias. Sorafenib exposure was highly variable between 
      patients but was within the ranges reported in adults. The apparent sorafenib 
      clearance increased with patient age. Diarrhea, rash, fatigue, and increased 
      ALT/AST were the most common sorafenib-related toxicities. Stable disease for 4 
      or more cycles was observed in 14 solid tumor patients, and 2 patients with acute 
      myeloid leukemia (AML) and FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3ITD) experienced 
      a decrease in bone marrow blasts to less than 5%. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended 
      phase II dose of sorafenib administered every 12 hours continuously for children 
      with solid tumors is 200 mg/m(2)/dose and 150 mg/m(2)/dose for children with 
      leukemias. Sorafenib toxicities and distribution in children are similar to 
      adults. The activity of sorafenib in children with AML and FLT3ITD is currently 
      being evaluated, and a phase II study for select solid tumors is ongoing.

TI  - Phase I clinical and pharmacokinetic study of sorafenib in combination with 
      carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
PG  - 844-53
LID - 10.1007/s10637-009-9321-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Unsatisfactory efficacy of current treatments for advanced lung 
      cancer has prompted the search for new therapies, with sorafenib, a multikinase 
      inhibitor, being one candidate drug. This phase I trial was conducted to evaluate 
      drug safety and pharmacokinetics as well as tumor response of sorafenib in 
      combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with advanced non-small 
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Eligible patients received paclitaxel (200 
      mg/m(2)) and carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC]of 6 mg min mL(-1)) on day 1 
      and sorafenib (400 mg, twice daily) on days 2 through 19 of a 21-day cycle. 
      RESULTS: Four of the initial six patients (cohort 1) experienced dose-limiting 
      toxicities (DLTs), resulting in amendment of the treatment protocol. An 
      additional seven patients (cohort 2) were enrolled, two of whom developed DLTs. 
      DLTs included erythema multiforme, hand-foot skin reaction, and elevated plasma 
      alanine aminotransferase in cohort 1 as well as gastrointestinal perforation at a 
      site of metastasis and pneumonia in cohort 2. Most adverse events were 
      manageable. One complete and six partial responses were observed among the 12 
      evaluable patients. Coadministration of the three drugs had no impact on their 
      respective pharmacokinetics. CONCLUSION: The present study confirmed that 
      sorafenib at 400 mg once daily in combination with carboplatin AUC 5 mg min 
      mL(-1) and paclitaxel 200 mg/m(2) is feasible in Japanese patients with advanced 
      NSCLC. The results of this study also showed that this combination therapy had 
      encouraging antitumor activity and was not associated with relevant 
      pharmacokinetic interaction in Japanese NSCLC patients.

AB  - This dose escalation, uncontrolled phase I study evaluated the tolerability, 
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and antitumor activity of oral sorafenib 100, 200, or 400 
      mg twice daily (bid, continuous regimen) in combination with 
      5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LCV, intravenous infusion or bolus) in patients 
      with advanced, solid tumors. A total of 47 patients (median age 57 years; colon 
      cancer, 55%; pancreatic cancer, 21%; prior systemic therapy, 96%) received 
      treatment; 24 were included in the PK analyses, and 38 were evaluable for tumor 
      response. Treatment-emergent adverse events were observed in 98% of patients 
      (≥grade 3, 55%); the most frequently reported were fatigue (51%), 
      stomatitis/pharyngitis (47%), and hand-foot skin reaction (45%). Concomitant 
      5-FU/LCV resulted in no clinically relevant changes in the area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve in the dosing interval (AUC(0-12)) and maximum plasma 
      concentration (C(max)) of sorafenib (100-400 mg bid) at steady state. Although 
      the start of infusion until the last quantifiable plasma concentration 
      (AUC(0-tn)) and C(max) of 5-FU were increased by concomitant sorafenib 100 to 200 
      mg, no consistent effect was observed with 400 mg sorafenib. Two (5%) patients 
      with colon cancer achieved partial response; 16 (42%) patients (the majority with 
      colon and pancreatic cancer) had stable disease. Sorafenib plus 5-FU/LCV was 
      generally well tolerated with encouraging antitumor activity and no clinically 
      relevant drug-drug interactions in patients with advanced solid tumors.

AB  - Sorafenib is a novel oral multikinase inhibitor that targets Raf serine/threonine 
      and receptor tyrosine kinases, and inhibits tumor cell proliferation and 
      angiogenesis. We have conducted a phase I study of sorafenib to determine the 
      safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and potential efficacy of this agent in 
      31 Japanese patients with advanced refractory solid tumors. Sorafenib (100-600 
      mg) was given as a single dose followed by a 7-day wash-out period, and then 
      administrated twice daily (bid). The most frequent drug-related adverse events 
      were rash/desquamation (61%), hand-foot skin reactions (39%), diarrhea (36%), and 
      elevations of serum lipase (36%) and amylase (26%) levels. Dose-limiting 
      toxicities (DLTs) were grade 3 diarrhea at 200 mg bid and grade 3 fatigue at 600 
      mg bid. Grade 3 and 4 pancreatic enzyme elevations were observed at 200-600 mg 
      bid, but they were not deemed dose-limiting because they were asymptomatic and 
      were not associated with pancreatitis or chronic damage to the pancreas. The AUC 
      and C(max) of sorafenib increased linearly with dose up to 400 mg bid. Partial 
      responses were observed in one of 10 patients with non-small cell lung cancer and 
      one of three patients with renal cell carcinoma. In conclusion, sorafenib 400 mg 
      bid was well tolerated in Japanese patients with advanced refractory solid 
      tumors. The recommended dose for future clinical trials is 400 mg bid.

TI  - Lack of effect of ketoconazole-mediated CYP3A inhibition on sorafenib clinical 
      pharmacokinetics.
PG  - 685-92
AB  - Sorafenib is a novel, small-molecule anticancer compound that inhibits tumor cell 
      proliferation by targeting Raf in the Raf/MEK/ERK signalling pathway, and 
      inhibits angiogenesis by targeting tyrosine kinases such as vascular-endothelial 
      growth factor receptor (VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3) and platelet-derived growth factor 
      receptor (PDGFR). In vitro microsomal data indicate that sorafenib is metabolized 
      by two pathways: phase I oxidation mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4; and 
      phase II conjugation mediated by UGT1A9. Approximately 50% of an orally 
      administered dose is recovered as unchanged drug in the feces, due to either 
      biliary excretion or lack of absorption. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
      the effect of CYP3A inhibition by ketoconazole on sorafenib pharmacokinetics. 
      This was an open-label, non-randomized, 2-period, one-way crossover study in 
      sixteen healthy male subjects. A single 50 mg dose of sorafenib was administered 
      alone (period 1) and in combination with ketoconazole 400 mg once daily (period 
      2) (ketoconazole was given for 7 days, and a single 50 mg sorafenib dose was 
      administered concomitantly on day 4). No clinically relevant change in 
      pharmacokinetics of sorafenib and no clinically relevant adverse events or 
      laboratory abnormalities were observed in this study upon co-administration of 
      the two drugs. Plasma concentrations of the main CYP3A4 generated metabolite, 
      sorafenib N-oxide, decreased considerably upon ketoconazole co-administration. 
      This effect is in accordance with the in vitro finding that CYP3A4 is the primary 
      enzyme for sorafenib N-oxide formation. Further, these data indicate that 
      blocking sorafenib metabolism by the CYP3A4 pathway will not lead to an increase 
      in sorafenib exposure. This is consistent with data from a clinical mass-balance 
      study that showed 15% of the administered dose was eliminated by glucuronidation, 
      compared to less than 5% eliminated as oxidative metabolites. Since there was no 
      increase in sorafenib exposure following concomitant administration of the highly 
      potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole with low dose sorafenib, it is postulated 
      that higher therapeutic doses of sorafenib may be safely co-administered with 
      ketoconazole, as well as with other inhibitors of CYP3A.

TI  - Population Pharmacokinetic Modelling and Simulation to Determine the Optimal Dose 
      of Nanoparticulated Sorafenib to the Reference Sorafenib.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics13050629 [doi]
LID - 629
AB  - Sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, exhibits a highly variable absorption 
      profile due to enterohepatic reabsorption and poor solubility. SYO-1644 improved 
      the solubility of sorafenib by nanoparticulation technology leading to enhanced 
      bioavailability. To evaluate the pharmacokinetically equivalent dose of SYO-1644 
      to the reference Nexavar(®) 200 mg, a randomized, open-label, replicated 
      two-period study was conducted in healthy volunteers. A total of 32 subjects 
      orally received a single dose of the following assigned treatment under a fasted 
      state in the first period and repeated once more in the second period with a 
      two-week washout: SYO-1644 100, 150 and 200 mg and Nexavar(®) 200 mg. 
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples were collected up to 168 h post-dose. The PK profile 
      was evaluated by both non-compartmental analysis and population PK method. With 
      the final model, 2 × 2 crossover trial scenarios with Nexavar(®) 200 mg and each 
      dose of SYO-1644 ranging from 100 to 150 mg were repeated 500 times by Monte 
      Carlo simulation, and the proportion of bioequivalence achievement was assessed. 
      Transit absorption compartments, followed by a one-compartment model with 
      first-order elimination and enterohepatic reabsorption components were selected 
      as the final model. The simulation results demonstrated that the SYO-1644 dose 
      between 120 and 125 mg could yielded the highest proportion of bioequivalence.

TI  - Phase I clinical and pharmacokinetic study of the Novel Raf kinase and vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptor inhibitor BAY 43-9006 in patients with 
      advanced refractory solid tumors.
PG  - 965-72
AB  - PURPOSE: BAY 43-9006 is a novel dual-action Raf kinase and vascular endothelial 
      growth factor receptor inhibitor that inhibits tumor cell proliferation and 
      angiogenesis. This study established the safety and pharmacokinetics of BAY 
      43-9006 in 69 patients with advanced refractory solid tumors. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: BAY 43-9006 (50 to 800 mg) was administered once or twice daily on a 
      varying weekly schedule. Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed in all patients; 
      preliminary tumor response was also assessed. The effect of BAY 43-9006 on 
      phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated ERK phosphorylation in peripheral blood 
      lymphocytes was studied using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Mild to moderate diarrhea 
      was the most common (55%) treatment-related adverse event. The maximum-tolerated 
      dose was 400 mg bid continuous. Dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 diarrhea 
      and fatigue at 800 mg bid, and grade 3 skin toxicity at 600 mg bid. BAY 43-9006 
      pharmacokinetics were highly variable for single and multiple dosing, and 
      toxicity did not appear to be dose dependent. Significant decreases of phorbol 
      myristate acetate-stimulated ERK phosphorylation (P < .01) were identified at 
      doses >/= 200 mg bid continuous. Forty-five patients were assessable for 
      efficacy; one patient had a partial response (hepatocellular carcinoma at 400 mg 
      bid continuous), 25 patients had stable disease, with eight lasting > 6 months 
      and five for >12 months. Eighteen patients had progressive disease, and tumor 
      response could not be evaluated in one patient. CONCLUSION: Oral BAY 43-9006 was 
      well tolerated and appeared to provide some clinical benefits. Based on the 
      results of this study, BAY 43-9006 at 400 mg bid continuous is recommended for 
      ongoing and future studies.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic Interaction between Sorafenib and Atorvastatin, and Sorafenib and 
      Metformin in Rats.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics12070600 [doi]
LID - 600
AB  - The tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib is the first-line treatment for patients 
      with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in which hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus (T2DM) may often coexist. Protein transporters like organic cation (OCT) 
      and multidrug and toxin extrusion (MATE) are involved in the response to 
      sorafenib, as well as in that to the anti-diabetic drug metformin or 
      atorvastatin, used in hyperlipidemia. Changes in the activity of these 
      transporters may lead to pharmacokinetic interactions, which are of clinical 
      significance. The study aimed to assess the sorafenib-metformin and 
      sorafenib-atorvastatin interactions in rats. The rats were divided into five 
      groups (eight animals in each) that received sorafenib and atorvastatin 
      (I(SOR+AT)), sorafenib and metformin (II(SOR+MET)), sorafenib (III(SOR)), 
      atorvastatin (IV(AT)), and metformin (V(MET)). Atorvastatin significantly 
      increased the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and the area under the plasma 
      concentration-time curve (AUC) of sorafenib by 134.4% (p < 0.0001) and 66.6% (p < 
      0.0001), respectively. Sorafenib, in turn, caused a significant increase in the 
      AUC of atorvastatin by 94.0% (p = 0.0038) and its metabolites 2-hydroxy 
      atorvastatin (p = 0.0239) and 4-hydroxy atorvastatin (p = 0.0002) by 55.3% and 
      209.4%, respectively. Metformin significantly decreased the AUC of sorafenib (p = 
      0.0065). The AUC ratio (II(SOR+MET) group/III(SOR) group) for sorafenib was equal 
      to 0.6. Sorafenib did not statistically significantly influence the exposure to 
      metformin. The pharmacokinetic interactions observed in this study may be of 
      clinical relevance in HCC patients with coexistent hyperlipidemia or T2DM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ERBB2 (HER2) pathways 
      and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-dependent angiogenesis have a 
      pivotal role in cancer pathogenesis and progression. Robust experimental evidence 
      has shown that these pathways are functionally linked and implicated in acquired 
      resistance to targeted therapies making them attractive candidates for joined 
      targeting. We undertook this phase I trial to assess the safety, the recommended 
      dose for phase II trials (RPTD), pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), 
      and the preliminary antitumour activity of the combination of lapatinib and 
      sorafenib in patients with advanced refractory solid tumours. METHODS: Four 
      cohorts of at least three patients each received lapatinib once daily and 
      sorafenib twice daily together on a continuous schedule. Doses of lapatinib and 
      sorafenib were escalated based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) in the first 
      treatment cycle following a traditional 3+3 design until the RPTD was reached. 
      Additional patients were treated at the RPTD to characterise PK profiles of this 
      combination and to investigate the potential interaction between lapatinib and 
      sorafenib. Serum samples were collected at baseline and then prospectively every 
      two cycles to assess changes in PD parameters. This trial is registered with 
      ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00984425. FINDINGS: Thirty patients with advanced 
      refractory solid tumours were enroled. DLTs were grade three fatigue and grade 3 
      atypical skin rash observed at dose levels 3 and 4, respectively. The higher dose 
      level explored (lapatinib 1250mg/day and sorafenib 400mg twice daily) represented 
      the RPTD of the combination. The most common drug-related adverse events were 
      fatigue (68%), hypocalcemia (61%), diarrhoea (57%), lymphopaenia (54%), anorexia 
      (50%), rash (50%), and hypophosphatemia (46%). PK analysis revealed no 
      significant effect of sorafenib on the PK profile of lapatinib. Of the 27 
      assessable patients for clinical activity, one achieved a confirmed complete 
      response, four (15%) had a partial response, and 12 (44%) achieved disease 
      stabilisation. The disease control rate overall was 63%. INTERPRETATION: 
      Combination treatment with lapatinib and sorafenib was feasible with promising 
      clinical activity and without significant PK interactions. Long term tolerability 
      seems to be challenging.

AB  - Sorafenib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of 
      advanced renal cell carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. By using a population 
      approach, this study aimed to characterise its pharmacokinetics. Plasma 
      concentration-time data (n = 372) from 71 patients under sorafenib were analysed 
      using nonlinear mixed-effect modelling to estimate population pharmacokinetic 
      parameters, as well as relationships between these parameters and different 
      covariates (demographic, biological). Simulations were done to compare different 
      daily dosing regimens in a context of dose-escalation. A 1-compartment model with 
      saturated absorption, first-order intestinal loss and elimination best described 
      the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib. Absolute bioavailability significantly dropped 
      with increasing daily doses of sorafenib. AUC increased less than proportionally 
      with increasing doses [47.3 (41.3-63.3), 60.3 (56.3-64.4), 71.4 (51.3-99.1), 75.9 
      (45.5-100.9) mg/L.h for 400, 800, 1,200 and 1,600 mg/day, respectively]. 
      According to the simulations, dividing the daily dose in three or four doses for 
      daily dose >800 mg would significantly increase AUC compared with a twice daily 
      dosing regimen (101.7 vs 81.6 mg/L.h for 400 mg q8h and 600 mg q12h respectively; 
      131.6 vs 91.5 mg/L.h for 400 mg q6h and 800 mg q12h, respectively). Thrice daily 
      regimen may be most suitable in a context of dose-escalation (>800 mg/day) in 
      non-responders to standard-dosing regimen.

TI  - A Pharmacokinetic Interaction Study of Sorafenib and Iced Teas in Rats Using 
      UPLC-MS/MS: An Illustration of Beverage-Drug Interaction.
PG  - 2410845

LID - 2410845
AB  - Iced teas (ITs), also known as ready-to-drink teas, have gained much popularity 
      among many nations. The modulatory effect of tea beverages on CYP3A4 increases 
      the possibility of their potential interactions with many coadministered 
      medications. Being a substrate of CYP3A4, sorafenib (SOR), the first-line therapy 
      for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma, shows a great probability to 
      exhibit pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction with ITs. For this purpose, different 
      groups of Wistar rats were given oral doses of SOR (40 mg/kg), along with 
      different types of ITs. The concentration of SOR in rat plasma was determined 
      using UPLC-MS/MS. Chromatographic analysis was performed on a C18 analytical 
      column, Acquity UPLC BEH™ (100 × 1.0 mm, i.d., 1.7 μm particle size), using 
      erlotinib (ERL) as an internal standard. Isocratic elution was performed with a 
      mobile phase consisting of two solvents: solvent A (water with 0.1% formic acid) 
      and solvent B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid), in a ratio of 30 : 70, v/v, 
      respectively. Quantitation was performed using MRM of the transitions from 
      protonated precursor ions [M+H](+) to product ions at m/z 465.12 > 252.02 (SOR) 
      and m/z 394.29 > 278.19 (ERL). The method was fully validated as per the FDA 
      guidance for bioanalytical method validation in the concentration range of 
      2.5-500 ng/mL. Different PK parameters were calculated for SOR in all rat groups 
      and groups administered with ITs and SOR, compared with groups with simply water 
      and SOR. Experimental data revealed that ITs caused a general reduction in SOR 
      bioavailability; an approximate reduction of 30% was recorded for all types of 
      tested ITs. These data indicate that ITs could affect the PK profile of SOR in 
      rats.

TI  - A phase I open-label study evaluating the cardiovascular safety of sorafenib in 
      patients with advanced cancer.

AB  - PURPOSE: To characterize the cardiovascular profile of sorafenib, a multitargeted 
      kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: Fifty-three patients 
      with advanced cancer received oral sorafenib 400 mg bid in continuous 28-day 
      cycles in this open-label study. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was 
      evaluated using multigated acquisition scanning at baseline and after 2 and 4 
      cycles of sorafenib. QT/QTc interval on the electrocardiograph (ECG) was measured 
      in triplicate with a Holter 12-lead ECG at baseline and after 1 cycle of 
      sorafenib. Heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) were obtained in duplicate at 
      baseline and after 1 and 4 cycles of sorafenib. Plasma pharmacokinetic data were 
      obtained for sorafenib and its 3 main metabolites after 1 and 4 cycles of 
      sorafenib. RESULTS: LVEF (SD) mean change from baseline was -0.8 (±8.6) LVEF(%) 
      after 2 cycles (n = 31) and -1.2 (±7.8) LVEF(%) after 4 cycles of sorafenib (n = 
      24). The QT/QTc mean changes from baseline observed at maximum sorafenib 
      concentrations (t(max)) after 1 cycle (n = 31) were small (QTcB: 4.2 ms; QTcF: 
      9.0 ms). Mean changes observed after 1 cycle in BP (n = 31) and HR (n = 30) at 
      maximum sorafenib concentrations (t(max)) were moderate (up to 11.7 mm Hg and 
      -6.6 bpm, respectively). No correlation was found between the AUC and C(max) of 
      sorafenib and its main metabolites and any cardiovascular parameters. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The effects of sorafenib on changes in QT/QTc interval on the ECG, 
      LVEF, BP, and HR were modest and unlikely to be of clinical significance in the 
      setting of advanced cancer treatment.

TI  - Phase I pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of the multikinase inhibitor 
      sorafenib in combination with clofarabine and cytarabine in pediatric 
      relapsed/refractory leukemia.
PG  - 3293-300
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2011.34.7427 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the toxicity, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of 
      multikinase inhibitor sorafenib in combination with clofarabine and cytarabine in 
      children with relapsed/refractory leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients 
      with acute leukemia (11 with acute myeloid leukemia [AML]) received sorafenib on 
      days 1 to 7 and then concurrently with cytarabine (1 g/m(2)) and clofarabine 
      (stratum one: 40 mg/m(2), n = 10; stratum two [recent transplantation or fungal 
      infection]: 20 mg/m(2), n = 2) on days 8 to 12. Sorafenib was continued until day 
      28 if tolerated. Two sorafenib dose levels (200 mg/m(2) and 150 mg/m(2) twice 
      daily) were planned. Sorafenib pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were 
      performed on days 7 and 8. RESULTS: At sorafenib 200 mg/m(2), two of four 
      patients in stratum one and one of two patients in stratum two had grade 3 
      hand-foot skin reaction and/or rash as dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). No DLTs 
      were observed in six patients in stratum one at sorafenib 150 mg/m(2). Sorafenib 
      inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT, S6 ribosomal protein, and 4E-BP1 in 
      leukemia cells. The rate of sorafenib conversion to its metabolite sorafenib 
      N-oxide was high (mean, 33%; range, 17% to 69%). In vitro, the N-oxide potently 
      inhibited FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD; binding constant, 70 nmol/L) and 
      the viability of five AML cell lines. On day 8, sorafenib decreased blast 
      percentages in 10 of 12 patients (median, 66%; range, 9% to 95%). After 
      combination chemotherapy, six patients (three FLT3-ITD and three FLT3 wild-type 
      AML) achieved complete remission, two (both FLT3-ITD AML) had complete remission 
      with incomplete blood count recovery, and one (FLT3 wild-type AML) had partial 
      remission. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib in combination with clofarabine and cytarabine 
      is tolerable and shows activity in relapsed/refractory pediatric AML.

AB  - Small-molecule inhibitors are promising antitumor drugs. We have designed and 
      synthesized a novel multi-targeted inhibitor, 
      2-methylcarbamoyl-4-{4-[3-(trifluoro-methyl)benzamido]phenoxy}pyridinium 
      (SKLB610), that potently inhibits human tumor growth. In the study, the 
      pharmacokinetic profile of SKLB610 was investigated. A simple, rapid and 
      sensitive high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection method was 
      developed for the determination of SKLB610 in rat plasma. Samples were extracted 
      with methanol and SKLB610 was separated on a C18 column using a mobile phase 
      system consisting of 55% acetonitrile and 45% water, with ultraviolet detection 
      at 270 nm. Sorafenib was used as the internal standard. The retention times of 
      SKLB610 and the internal standard were 5.6 and 8.1 min, respectively. The 
      quantification limit was 67 ng/mL. The calibration curves were linear over a 
      concentration range of 0.1-50 µg/mL. The inter-day and intra-day accuracy and 
      precision were within ± 10%. The recovery and stability of the assay were 
      evaluated from spiked rat plasma. The method was successfully applied to a 
      pharmacokinetic study of SKLB610 in rats. The pharmacokinetic profile of SKLB610 
      indicated that the oral formulations should be further optimized to improve 
      bioavailability and intravenous formulation of SKLB610 should be developed.

TI  - A phase I and pharmacokinetic study of ganetespib (STA-9090) in advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 128-37
LID - 10.1007/s10637-014-0164-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ganetespib (STA-9090) is an Hsp90 inhibitor that downregulates VEGFR, 
      c-MET, HER2, IGF-IR, EGFR, and other Hsp90 client proteins involved in 
      hepatocarcinogenesis, thereby making it an attractive therapy for HCC. This Phase 
      I study was performed to establish the safety, tolerability, recommended Phase 2 
      dose (RP2D), and preliminary clinical activity of ganetespib in previously 
      treated patients with advanced HCC. METHODS: Patients with advanced HCC, 
      Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, progression on or intolerance to sorafenib, and ECOG 
      PS ≤ 1 were enrolled in a standard 3x3 dose escalation study at doses of 100 
      mg/m(2), 150 mg/m(2), and 200 mg/m(2) IV given on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 
      28-day cycle. Objective response by RECIST version 1.1 criteria was evaluated by 
      CT/MRI every 8 weeks. RESULTS: Fourteen patients were enrolled in this trial and 
      received at least one dose of the study drug. Of the 14 patients: median age, 57 
      years old; male 71 %; Asian 36 %; HCC etiology (HBV 36 %, HCV 43 %, 
      Hemachromatosis 7 %, unknown 21 %); Child Pugh Class (A 93 %, B 7 %); median 
      number of prior treatments 2; median baseline AFP 70.1 ng/mL. The RP2D was 
      determined to be 200 mg/m(2). The most commonly seen AEs were diarrhea (93 %), 
      fatigue (71 %), AST elevation (64 %), and hyperglycemia (64 %). The most common 
      Gr 3/4 AEs were hyperglycemia (21 %) and lipasemia (21 %). One (7 %) patient had 
      a fatal AE, septic shock, within 30 days of receiving the study drug. One 
      dose-limiting toxicity, grade 3 lipasemia, was observed at the 100 mg/m(2) dose. 
      Pharmacokinetics studies showed a t1/2, CL, Tmax, and Vss of 6.45 h, 48.28 L/h 
      (25.56 L/h/m(2)), 0.76 h, and 191 L (100.4 L/m(2)), respectively. No objective 
      responses were seen; one patient (7 %) had stable disease at 16 weeks. Median 
      time to progression was 1.8 months, and median overall survival was 7.2 months. 
      CONCLUSION: Ganetespib had a manageable safety profile in patients with advanced 
      HCC who had progressed on at least one line of systemic therapy. The 
      pharmacokinetic profile showed that ganetespib exposure in patients with mild 
      hepatic dysfunction is similar to that seen in patients with normal liver 
      function. Ganetespib showed limited clinical benefit in patients with advanced 
      HCC in this phase I trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib,an orally bioavailable, multitarget tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitor, and irinotecan, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, have demonstrated 
      activity in pediatric and adult malignancies. We evaluated the toxicity, 
      pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacogenomic (PGX) profile of sorafenib with 
      irinotecan in children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors and assessed the 
      feasibility of incorporating patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures as an 
      adjunct to traditional endpoints. METHODS: Sorafenib, continuous oral twice daily 
      dosing, was administered with irinotecan, orally, once daily days 1-5, repeated 
      every 21 days (NCT01518413). Based on tolerability, escalation of sorafenib 
      followed by escalation of irinotecan was planned. Three patients were initially 
      enrolled at each dose level. Sorafenib and irinotecan PK analyses were performed 
      during cycle 1. PRO measurements were collected during cycles 1 and 2. RESULTS: 
      Fifteen patients were evaluable. Two of three patients at dose level 2 
      experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), grade 3 diarrhea, and grade 3 
      hyponatremia. Therefore, dose level 1 was expanded to 12 patients and two 
      patients had DLT, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, grade 3 elevated lipase. Nine of 15 
      (60%) patients had a best response of stable disease with four patients receiving 
      ≥6 cycles. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended dose for pediatric patients was sorafenib 
      150 mg/m(2) /dose twice daily with irinotecan 70 mg/m(2) /dose daily × 5 days 
      every 21 days. This oral outpatient regimen was well tolerated and resulted in 
      prolonged disease stabilization. There were no significant alterations in the PK 
      profile of either agent when administered in combination. Patients were willing 
      and able to report their subjective experiences with this regimen.

TI  - Phase Ib Study of Enzalutamide with or Without Sorafenib in Patients with 
      Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - e1825-e1836
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2020-0521 [doi]
AB  - LESSONS LEARNED: Androgen receptor as assessed by immunohistochemistry is 
      expressed in a high proportion of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
      Enzalutamide at 160 mg orally daily is safe and tolerable in patients with 
      advanced HCC but has no single-agent antitumor activity. Enzalutamide, a CYP3A4 
      inducer, at a standard dose of 160 mg reduces the exposure of sorafenib, a CYP3A4 
      substrate. Enzalutamide and sorafenib is safe and tolerable in patients with 
      advanced HCC, but the addition of enzalutamide to sorafenib did not enhance the 
      antitumor activity of sorafenib. BACKGROUND: Androgen receptor (AR) interference 
      is deleterious to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in preclinical models. METHODS: 
      This is a multicenter, phase Ib study of enzalutamide ± sorafenib in patients 
      with advanced HCC. In part 1, a 3 + 3 dose de-escalation design with expansion 
      established the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of enzalutamide in patients in 
      whom sorafenib treatment had failed. In part 2, a 3 + 3 dose escalation with 
      expansion established the safety of enzalutamide with sorafenib in 
      treatment-naive patients with HCC. Secondary objectives included objective 
      response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), 
      pharmacokinetics (PK), and determination of AR expression by 
      immunohistochemistry. A 7-day run-in with sorafenib alone in part 2 allowed 
      assessment of the impact of enzalutamide on sorafenib pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: 
      In part 1, 16 patients received enzalutamide 160 mg daily. No dose-limiting 
      toxicity (DLT) occurred; 1 patient required dose reduction. Responses were not 
      observed; median PFS and OS were 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.6-3.6) and 
      7 (95% CI: 3.6 to not reached [NR]) months, respectively. In part 2, patients 
      received sorafenib 400 mg daily (4) or twice a day (8) both with enzalutamide at 
      the recommended phase II dose-no DLTs were observed. ORR was 10% (95% CI: 
      0.3-44.5), and median PFS and OS were 2.9 (95% CI: 1.6 to NR) and 6.7 (95% CI: 
      4.6 to NR) months, respectively. Enzalutamide reduced sorafenib exposure by 60%. 
      Tumor AR expression did not associate with outcome. CONCLUSION: Enzalutamide is 
      ineffective in HCC; further development is not supported by this study.

TI  - Clinical results and pharmacokinetics of sorafenib in chronic hemodialysis 
      patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma in a single center.
PG  - 647-55
LID - 10.1093/jjco/hyr015 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the safety and feasibility of sorafenib in patients 
      with end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis by examining the influence 
      of pharmacokinetic parameters to their benefit and also the occurrence of 
      drug-related adverse events of sorafenib. METHODS: Ten patients with metastatic 
      renal cell carcinoma undergoing hemodialysis received sorafenib. Initial dose was 
      200 mg once daily, and the dose was increased up to the maintenance dose of 200 
      mg twice daily. The pharmacokinetic study was performed after a steady state was 
      reached with 200 mg twice daily in six patients. RESULTS: Complete response 
      occurred in one patient, partial response in three, stable disease in four and 
      progressive disease in two. Median progression-free survival was 6.3 months. 
      Serious adverse events were found in nine patients, including a Grade 5 
      subarachnoid hemorrhage and a Grade 4 cerebellar hemorrhage. In the 
      pharmacokinetic study, the geometric mean of maximum concentration and area under 
      the curve from 0 to 10 h of plasma concentration were similar on the day of 
      hemodialysis and the day off hemodialysis. These data were lower than those from 
      Japanese people with healthy kidneys and normal kidney function. There was no 
      association between objective response or the occurrence of serious adverse 
      events and pharmacokinetic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with sorafenib of 
      patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma undergoing hemodialysis appears to 
      be feasible, but we express some concern about the higher incidence of serious 
      adverse events even with the reduced dose. However, clinical efficacy was not 
      compromised.

TI  - Phase I pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of cetuximab, irinotecan and 
      sorafenib in advanced colorectal cancer.
PG  - 345-54
LID - 10.1007/s10637-012-9820-z [doi]
AB  - Background This phase Ib study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated 
      doses (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of irinotecan and cetuximab with 
      sorafenib. Secondary objectives included characterizing the pharmacokinetics and 
      pharmacodynamics and evaluating preliminary antitumor activity in patients with 
      advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods Patients with metastatic, pretreated 
      CRC were treated at five dose levels. Results Eighteen patients were recruited 
      with median age 56.5 years. In the first five patients treated, 2 irinotecan 
      related DLTs were observed. With reduced dose intensity irinotecan, there were no 
      further DLTs. The most common toxicities were diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, fatigue, 
      anorexia and rash. DLTs included neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Two patients 
      had partial responses (one with a KRAS mutation) and 8 had stable disease 
      (8-36 weeks). The median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival 
      (OS) were 2.5 and 4.7 months respectively. Pharmacokinetic analyses suggest 
      sorafenib and metabolite exposure correlate with OS and DLTs. Conclusions The 
      recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is irinotecan 100 mg/m(2) i.v. days 1, 8; 
      cetuximab 400 mg/m(2) i.v. days 1 and 250 mg/m(2) i.v. weekly; and sorafenib 
      400 mg orally twice daily in advanced, pretreated CRC. The combination resulted 
      in a modest response rate.

TI  - Sorafenib in the Treatment of Early Breast Cancer: Results of the Neoadjuvant 
      Phase II Study - SOFIA.
PG  - 169-74
LID - 10.1159/000363430 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib was tested for neoadjuvant treatment with an 
      anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy in the open-label, multicentre, 
      single-arm phase II study, 'SOFIA'. PATIENTS AND METHODS: INCLUSION CRITERIA 
      WERE: HER2 negative, cT3, cT4 or cT2 cN+, M0 primary breast cancer. Patients 
      received 4 × epirubicin 90 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) (EC) 
      intravenously (i.v.) in 3-weekly cycles followed or preceded by 12 weeks of 
      paclitaxel (Pw) 80 mg/m(2). In cohort 1, sorafenib started at 800 mg daily with 
      chemotherapy. An initial daily sorafenib dose of 200 mg was escalated, based on 
      individual toxicities, every 3 weeks in cohort 2 (starting with EC) and every 2 
      weeks in cohort 3 (starting with Pw). The primary objective was to identify the 
      most feasible regimen; secondary objectives were safety, pathological complete 
      response (pCR) at surgery and pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: Of the 36 recruited 
      patients, 7/12 patients completed the study in cohort 1 and 24/24 patients in 
      cohorts 2 and 3. The median cumulative sorafenib dose per patient was 37%, 65% 
      and 46% in cohorts 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The main grade 3-4 toxicities were 
      neutropenia and hand-foot syndrome. The pCR (ypT0/is) rate was 27.7%. No 
      pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between sorafenib and epirubicin. 
      CONCLUSION: Sorafenib EC-Pw is feasible if the starting dose is 200 mg, escalated 
      every 3 weeks based on the patients' individual toxicities.

TI  - Safety and pharmacokinetics of ganitumab (AMG 479) combined with sorafenib, 
      panitumumab, erlotinib, or gemcitabine in patients with advanced solid tumors.
PG  - 3414-27
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-3369 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This phase 1b dose-escalation study assessed safety, tolerability, and 
      pharmacokinetics of ganitumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against the 
      insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) receptor, combined with targeted agents or 
      cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. EXPERIMENTAL 
      DESIGN: Patients with treatment-refractory advanced solid tumors were 
      sequentially enrolled at 2 ganitumab dose levels (6 or 12 mg/kg i.v. every 2 
      weeks) combined with either sorafenib 400 mg twice daily, panitumumab 6 mg/kg 
      every 2 weeks, erlotinib 150 mg once daily, or gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on days 
      1, 8, and 15 of each 4-week cycle. The primary end points were safety and 
      pharmacokinetics of ganitumab. RESULTS: Ganitumab up to 12 mg/kg appeared well 
      tolerated combined with sorafenib, panitumumab, erlotinib, or gemcitabine. 
      Treatment-emergent adverse events were generally mild and included fatigue, 
      nausea, vomiting, and chills. Three patients had dose-limiting toxicities: grade 
      3 hyperglycemia (ganitumab 6 mg/kg and panitumumab), grade 4 neutropenia 
      (ganitumab 6 mg/kg and gemcitabine), and grade 4 thrombocytopenia (ganitumab 12 
      mg/kg and erlotinib). Ganitumab-binding and panitumumab-binding antibodies were 
      detected in 5 and 2 patients, respectively; neutralizing antibodies were not 
      detected. The pharmacokinetics of ganitumab and each cotherapy did not appear 
      affected by coadministration. Circulating total IGF1 and IGF binding protein 3 
      increased from baseline following treatment. Four patients (9%) had partial 
      responses. CONCLUSIONS: Ganitumab up to 12 mg/kg was well tolerated, without 
      adverse effects on pharmacokinetics in combination with either sorafenib, 
      panitumumab, erlotinib, or gemcitabine. Ganitumab is currently under 
      investigation in combination with some of these and other agents.

TI  - A phase 1b study of transforming growth factor-beta receptor I inhibitor 
      galunisertib in combination with sorafenib in Japanese patients with unresectable 
      hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 118-126
LID - 10.1007/s10637-018-0636-3 [doi]
AB  - Background Galunisertib inhibits type I transforming growth factor-beta receptor 
      serine/threonine kinase. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the 
      safety and tolerability of galunisertib in combination with sorafenib in Japanese 
      patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients and methods This 
      open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter, nonrandomized phase 1b study consisted 
      of two dose levels of galunisertib, 160 or 300 mg/day, in combination with 
      sorafenib 800 mg/day. Galunisertib 80 mg or 150 mg was administered orally twice 
      daily for 14 days followed by 14 days of rest plus sorafenib 400 mg administered 
      orally twice daily for 28 days. The dose-limiting toxicity evaluation was 28 days 
      after the first dose. Safety measures, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity 
      were assessed. Results Fourteen patients, 7 at each galunisertib dose, were 
      enrolled and treated. Three dose-limiting toxicities were reported for 2 
      patients. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were 
      hypophosphatemia (14 patients [100%]), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome 
      (12 patients [85.7%]), and decreased platelet count (10 patients [71.4%]). The 
      most common grade ≥ 3 TEAEs were hypophosphatemia (10 patients [71.4%]) and 
      palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (7 patients [50.0%]). No grade 5 TEAEs 
      were reported. The pharmacokinetic profile of galunisertib in combination with 
      sorafenib was similar to that previously reported for galunisertib. Eleven 
      patients had a best overall response of stable disease, and 1 patient achieved a 
      partial response by hepatocellular carcinoma-specific modified RECIST. 
      Conclusions These data are consistent with the known safety profile for 
      galunisertib and sorafenib and confirm tolerability of the recommended dose of 
      galunisertib (150 mg twice daily for 14 days) in combination with sorafenib in 
      Japanese patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.

      glioma.
PG  - 1324-30
LID - 10.1093/neuonc/nor145 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib is an inhibitor of multiple kinases that has demonstrated 
      antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activity in a number of in vitro and in vivo 
      model systems. A phase I study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated 
      dose (MTD) of sorafenib in patients with recurrent malignant glioma. Sorafenib 
      was given orally, twice a day (BID), continuously in 28-day cycles. The dose was 
      escalated in 2 groups of patients stratified by use of enzyme-inducing 
      antiseizure drugs (± EIASDs). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was defined as any 
      grades 3-4 nonhematological toxicity, grade 4 hematological toxicity, and febrile 
      neutropenia. The number of evaluable patients enrolled in the +EIASD and -EIASD 
      arms were 23 and 24, respectively. DLTs were predominantly dermatological and 
      gastrointestinal effects, as observed in previous clinical trials of sorafenib. 
      The MTD was 600 mg BID for patients receiving EIASDs and 800 mg BID for those who 
      were not. The plasma pharmacokinetics of sorafenib were not significantly 
      affected by the concurrent administration of EIASDs. The MTD of sorafenib given 
      orally BID on a continuous basis was established as 600 mg BID in patients with 
      malignant glioma who were concurrently receiving EIASDs and 800 mg BID in those 
      who were not. Further evaluation is warranted of sorafenib at the recommended MTD 
      against recurrent or progressive malignant glioma in combination with other 
      molecularly targeted drugs or in the newly diagnosed setting concurrent with 
      chemoradiation.

TI  - Phase I study of sorafenib in Japanese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 159-65
AB  - Sorafenib is an orally active multikinase inhibitor that targets serine and 
      threonine, and tyrosine kinases that are involved in tumor-cell signal 
      transduction and tumor angiogenesis. This phase I trial was conducted to evaluate 
      the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and preliminary efficacy of sorafenib in 
      Japanese patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with underlying liver 
      dysfunction. Patients with unresectable HCC, Child-Pugh status A or B, and 
      adequate organ functions were treated. A single dose of sorafenib was 
      administered, followed by a 7-day wash-out period, after which patients received 
      either sorafenib 200 mg (cohort 1) or 400 mg (cohort 2) twice daily. The PK were 
      investigated after a single dose and during steady state. The efficacy was 
      evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. A total of 27 
      patients were evaluated for PK, safety, and efficacy. Although both area under 
      the concentration-time curve for 0-12 h and maximal concentration at steady state 
      were slightly lower in Child-Pugh B patients than in Child-Pugh A patients, the 
      difference was not considered to be clinically relevant. Common adverse drug 
      events included elevated lipase, amylase, rash or desquamation, diarrhea, and 
      hand-foot skin reaction. A dose-limiting toxicity of hand-foot skin reaction was 
      observed in one patient (cohort 2). Among the 24 patients evaluable for tumor 
      response, one patient (4%) achieved a partial response, 20 (83%) had stable 
      disease, and three (13%) had progressive disease. Sorafenib demonstrated a 
      favorable tolerability and safety profile in Japanese HCC patients. Moreover, 
      promising preliminary antitumor activity has been observed. Finally, there were 
      no clinically relevant differences in PK between Child-Pugh A and B patients.

TI  - Preclinical Pharmacokinetic Interaction and Histopathological Analyses of 
      Hedyotis diffusa on Sorafenib in Rats.
PG  - 3060-3067
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.0c05461 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib is one of the most effective target therapeutic agents for patients 
      with late-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. To seek possible alternative adjuvant 
      agents to enhance the efficacy and improve the side effect of sorafenib, Hedyotis 
      diffusa, one of the most prescribed phytomedicines for treating liver cancer 
      patients in Taiwan, was evaluated in this work. We hypothesized that H. diffusa 
      extract is a safety herb combination on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      effects of sorafenib. We designed treatments of sorafenib in combination with or 
      without H. diffusa extract to examine its pharmacokinetic properties and effects 
      on liver inflammation. The HPLC-photodiode-array method was designed for 
      monitoring the plasma level and pharmacokinetic parameter of sorafenib in rat 
      plasma. The pharmacokinetic results demonstrated that the area under the curve of 
      sorafenib (10 mg/kg, p.o.) in combination with various doses of H. diffusa 
      formulation (1, 3, and 10 g/kg, p.o.) for 5 consecutive days were 5560 ± 1392, 
      7965 ± 2055, 7271 ± 1371, and 8821 ± 1705 min μg/mL, respectively, no significant 
      difference when compared with sorafenib treatment alone. Furthermore, the hepatic 
      activity in rats administered with sorafenib with/without H. diffusa extract was 
      quantitatively scored by modified hepatic activity index grading. H. diffusa 
      extract in the range of 1 to 10 g/kg per day did not elicit significant 
      herb-induced hepatotoxicity in rats, based on the histopathological study. 
      Consequently, our findings provided positive safety outcomes for the 
      administration of sorafenib in combination with the phytomedicine H. diffusa.

TI  - Chase Dosing of Lipid Formulations to Enhance Oral Bioavailability of Nilotinib 
      in Rats.
PG  - 124
LID - 10.1007/s11095-020-02841-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Lipid-based formulations (LBF) have shown oral bioavailability 
      enhancement of lipophilic drugs, but not necessarily in the case of hydrophobic 
      drugs. This study explored the potential of lipid vehicles to improve the 
      bioavailability of the hydrophobic drug nilotinib comparing a chase dosing 
      approach and lipid suspensions. METHODS: Nilotinib in vivo bioavailability in 
      rats was determined after administering an aqueous suspension chase dosed with 
      blank olive oil, Captex 1000, Peceol or Capmul MCM, respectively. Absolute 
      bioavailability was determined (relative to an intravenous formulation). 
      Pharmacokinetic parameters were compared to lipid suspensions. RESULTS: Compared 
      to the lipid suspensions, the chase dosed lipids showed a 2- to 7-fold higher 
      bioavailability. Both long chain chase dosed excipients also significantly 
      increased the bioavailability up to 2-fold compared to the aqueous suspension. 
      Deconvolution of the pharmacokinetic data indicated that chase dosing of 
      nilotinib resulted in prolonged absorption compared to the aqueous suspension. 
      CONCLUSION: Chase dosed LBF enhanced the in vivo bioavailability of nilotinib. 
      Long chain lipids showed superior performance compared to medium chain lipids. 
      Chase dosing appeared to prolong the absorption phase of the drug. Therefore, 
      chase dosing of LBF is favourable compared to lipid suspensions for 'brick dust' 
      molecules such as nilotinib. Graphical Abstract The potential of bio-enabling 
      lipid vehicles, administered via chase dosing and lipid suspensions, has been 
      evaluated as an approach to enhance oral bioavailability of nilotinib.

TI  - Sorafenib exposure decreases over time in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 2046-9
LID - 10.1007/s10637-011-9764-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intra-patient variability in sorafenib pharmacokinetics has been 
      poorly investigated to date. We hypothesized that sorafenib clearance could 
      decrease over time, as seen with imatinib. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sorafenib plasma 
      concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography, every 2 weeks, in 
      consecutive hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with sorafenib. Sorafenib 
      dose-normalized area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was determined from 
      a population pharmacokinetics model, and its kinetics was analyzed in order to 
      identify possible alterations of exposure over time. RESULTS: Fifteen 
      hepatocellular carcinoma patients with Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, in whom sorafenib 
      dosing remained unchanged from initiation of treatment to disease progression, 
      were eligible for this analysis. Sorafenib AUC significantly decreased over time: 
      the median AUC during the third month of treatment was lower than that observed 
      after one month of treatment (43.0 vs. 60.3 mg/L.h, p = 0.008). Most importantly, 
      median sorafenib AUC at the time of progression was almost two-fold lower than 
      that observed after one month of therapy (33.2 vs. 60.3 mg/L.h, p = 0.007). These 
      findings suggest an induction of expression of efflux transporters in the gut 
      wall, or an induction of sorafenib metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with 
      progressive disease in whom exposure markedly decreased from baseline, sorafenib 
      dose escalation could be considered, aiming to restore an adequate drug exposure 
      and possibly anti-tumor activity.

TI  - PR-104 plus sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 539-45
LID - 10.1007/s00280-011-1671-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: PR-104 is activated by reductases under hypoxia or by aldo-keto 
      reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) to form cytotoxic nitrogen mustards. Hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) displays extensive hypoxia and expresses AKR1C3. This study 
      evaluated the safety and efficacy of PR-104 plus sorafenib in HCC. METHODS: 
      Patients with advanced-stage HCC, Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, and adequate organ 
      function, were assigned to dose escalating cohorts of monthly PR-104 in 
      combination with twice daily sorafenib. The plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
      PR-104 and its metabolites were evaluated. RESULTS: Fourteen (11 men, 3 women) 
      HCC patients: median age 60 years, ECOG 0-1, received PR-104 at two dose levels 
      plus sorafenib. Six patients were treated at starting cohort of 770 mg/m(2). In 
      view of one DLT of febrile neutropenia and prolonged thrombocytopenia, a lower 
      PR-104 dose cohort (550 mg/m(2)) was added and accrued 8 patients. One patient 
      had a partial response and three had stable disease of ≥8 weeks in the 770 
      mg/m(2) cohort. Three patients at the 550 mg/m(2) had stable disease. There were 
      no differences in PK of PR-104 or its metabolites with or without sorafenib, but 
      the PR-104A AUC was twofold higher (P < 0.003) than in previous phase I studies 
      at equivalent dose. CONCLUSIONS: PR-104 plus sorafenib was poorly tolerated in 
      patients with advanced HCC, possibly because of compromised clearance of PR-104A 
      in this patient population. Thrombocytopenia mainly and neutropenia were the most 
      clinically significant toxicities and led to discontinuation of the study. PR-104 
      plus sorafenib is unlikely to be suitable for development in this setting.

TI  - The Influence of Paracetamol on the Penetration of Sorafenib and Sorafenib 
      N-Oxide Through the Blood-Brain Barrier in Rats.
PG  - 801-808
LID - 10.1007/s13318-020-00639-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Sorafenib is an oral, multikinase inhibitor with 
      established single-agent activity in several tumor types. Sorafenib was 
      moderately transported by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and more efficiently by breast 
      cancer resistance protein. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) is a 
      ligand-activated transcription factor involved in P-gp regulation in the brain 
      microvasculature. Paracetamol is a CAR activator. The purpose of this study was 
      to investigate the effect of paracetamol on the brain uptake of sorafenib and 
      sorafenib N-oxide. METHODS: The rats were assigned to two groups-rats receiving 
      oral paracetamol 100 mg/kg and sorafenib 100 mg/kg (n = 42, I(SR+PA)) and rats 
      receiving oral vehicle and sorafenib 100 mg/kg (n = 42, II(SR)). The sorafenib 
      and sorafenib N-oxide concentrations in blood plasma and brain tissue were 
      determined by a high-performance liquid chromatography method with ultraviolet 
      detection. Brain-to-plasma partition coefficient (K(p)) was calculated as a ratio 
      of the area under the curve from zero to 24 h (AUC) in the brain and plasma. A 
      drug targeting index (DTI) was estimated as the group I(SR+PA) K(p) to group 
      II(SR) K(p) ratio. RESULTS: Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed increased brain 
      exposure to sorafenib and sorafenib N-oxide after co-administration of 
      paracetamol. The brain maximum concentration (C(max)) and the AUC of the parent 
      drug in the I(SR+PA) group compared with the II(SR) group were greater by 49.5 
      and 77.8%, respectively, and the same parameters for the metabolite were higher 
      by 51.4 and 50.9%. However, the K(p) values of sorafenib and sorafenib N-oxide 
      did not differ significantly between the two animal groups and the DTI values 
      were close to 1. CONCLUSION: Paracetamol increases exposure to sorafenib and 
      sorafenib N-oxide in the brain, likely due to increased exposure in plasma.

TI  - An apparent clinical pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between bevacizumab 
      and the anti-placental growth factor monoclonal antibody RO5323441 via a 
      target-trapping mechanism.
PG  - 661-671
LID - 10.1007/s00280-017-3242-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: RO5323441 is a humanized anti-placental growth factor (PlGF) monoclonal 
      antibody that has shown preclinical activity in several cancer models. The 
      objective of this analysis is to examine the pharmacokinetic (PK) results from 
      four Phase I studies that have been conducted with RO5323441 (n = 61) and to 
      report an apparent drug-drug interaction observed when RO5323441 was administered 
      in combination with bevacizumab. METHODS: The four Phase I studies were a 
      multiple-ascending dose study in 23 patients with solid tumors (Study 1), an 
      open-label study in seven patients with colorectal/ovarian cancer (Study 2), a 
      sorafenib combination study in nine patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (Study 
      3), and a bevacizumab combination study in 22 patients with recurrent 
      glioblastoma (Study 4). A two-compartment linear population PK model was 
      developed from these four studies to characterize the PK of RO5323441 in patients 
      with cancer. RESULTS: The PK properties of RO5323441 were similar in the first 
      three studies. However, substantially higher RO5323441 exposures were observed in 
      Study 4 when RO5323441 was administered in combination with bevacizumab. A linear 
      two-compartmental population PK model indicated that the co-administration of 
      bevacizumab would decrease the clearance of RO5323441 by 53%. Clinical data 
      suggested that the decrease in RO5323441 clearance was inversely associated with 
      bevacizumab exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The exact reason for the increase in RO5323441 
      exposure following bevacizumab co-administration is not currently known. One 
      possibility is a drug-drug interaction via a target-trapping mechanism that is 
      mediated by the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR-1).

TI  - Pharmacokinetic interaction between sorafenib and prednisolone in a patient with 
      hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 269-72
LID - 10.1007/s00280-013-2187-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib is primarily metabolized in the liver, by CYP3A4-mediated 
      oxidation and UGT1A9-mediated glucuronidation. However, there is little 
      information about the pharmacokinetic interaction of sorafenib. Here, we report a 
      pharmacokinetic interaction between sorafenib and the CYP3A4 inducer prednisolone 
      in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 
      patient was a 72-year-old woman diagnosed with HCC. She was treated with 
      sorafenib at 400 mg daily. On day 9, sorafenib was discontinued due to drug 
      eruption. Nine months later, she was rechallenged with sorafenib at 400 mg daily 
      concurrently with oral prednisolone. Prednisolone was started at 20 mg daily and 
      was tapered by 5 mg every 14 days. We assessed the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib 
      and its major metabolite M-2. RESULTS: The concentration of sorafenib was 
      gradually increased following tapering of prednisolone. On day 56 after 
      rechallenge, she developed G3 oral mucositis. At this time, serum trough 
      concentrations of sorafenib and M-2 were at 5.9 and 1.1 μg/ml, respectively. 
      Consequently, sorafenib dosage was reduced to 200 mg daily, and the oral 
      mucositis was attenuated. The subsequent concentrations of sorafenib and M-2 
      obtained with a dose of 200 mg daily ranged from 1 to 3 μg/ml and from 0.1 to 0.4 
      μg/ml, respectively. Computed tomography scan showed a complete response of the 
      liver tumor with no further recurrence of the rash. CONCLUSIONS: We have 
      demonstrated for the first time that prednisolone stimulates the sorafenib 
      metabolism and that therapeutic drug monitoring could be useful during sorafenib 
      therapy.

PG  - 2901-10
LID - 10.2147/IJN.S32415 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib solid lipid nanoparticles (S-SLN) were prepared by emulsion 
      evaporation-solidification at low temperature. Morphology was examined by 
      transmission electron microscope. Particle size and zeta potential were 
      determined by laser granularity equipment. Encapsulation efficiency (EE) was 
      detected by Sephadex gel chromatography and high-performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC). The in vitro release profile of S-SLN was studied with 
      dialysis technology. The lyophilized injection of S-SLN was prepared by freeze 
      drying and analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry. The plasma 
      concentration of sorafenib in blood was determined by HPLC. The solid lipid 
      nanoparticles assumed a spherical shape with an even distribution of diameter and 
      particle size 108.23 ± 7.01 nm (n = 3). The polydispersity index, zeta potential, 
      and EE were determined to be 0.25 ± 0.02, -16.37 ± 0.65 mV, and 93.49% ± 1.87%, 
      respectively (n = 3). The in vitro release accorded with the Weibull distribution 
      model. An equal volume of 15% (w/v) mannitol performed better as the protective 
      agent for a lyophilized injection of S-SLN with a new material phase formation. 
      The pharmacokinetic processes of sorafenib solution and lyophilized injection of 
      S-SLN in vivo were in accordance with the two-compartment and one-compartment 
      models, respectively. S-SLN nanoparticles are thus considered a promising 
      drug-delivery system.

TI  - Sorafenib Population Pharmacokinetics and Skin Toxicities in Children and 
      Adolescents with Refractory/Relapsed Leukemia or Solid Tumor Malignancies.
PG  - 7320-7330
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-0470 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the pharmacokinetics and skin toxicity profile of sorafenib 
      in children with refractory/relapsed malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Sorafenib was administered concurrently or sequentially with clofarabine and 
      cytarabine to patients with leukemia or with bevacizumab and cyclophosphamide to 
      patients with solid tumor malignancies. The population pharmacokinetics (PPK) of 
      sorafenib and its metabolites and skin toxicities were evaluated. RESULTS: In PPK 
      analysis, older age, bevacizumab and cyclophosphamide regimen, and higher 
      creatinine were associated with decreased sorafenib apparent clearance (CL/f; P < 
      0.0001 for all), and concurrent clofarabine and cytarabine administration was 
      associated with decreased sorafenib N-oxide CL/f (P = 7e-4). Higher bilirubin was 
      associated with decreased sorafenib N-oxide and glucuronide CL/f (P = 1e-4). 
      Concurrent use of organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 inhibitors was 
      associated with increased sorafenib and decreased sorafenib glucuronide CL/f (P < 
      0.003). In exposure-toxicity analysis, a shorter time to development of grade 2-3 
      hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) was associated with concurrent (P = 0.0015) but 
      not with sequential (P = 0.59) clofarabine and cytarabine administration, 
      compared with bevacizumab and cyclophosphamide, and with higher steady-state 
      concentrations of sorafenib (P = 0.0004) and sorafenib N-oxide (P = 0.0275). In 
      the Bayes information criterion model selection, concurrent clofarabine and 
      cytarabine administration, higher sorafenib steady-state concentrations, larger 
      body surface area, and previous occurrence of rash appeared in the four best 
      two-predictor models of HFSR. Pharmacokinetic simulations showed that once-daily 
      and every-other-day sorafenib schedules would minimize exposure to sorafenib 
      steady-state concentrations associated with HFSR. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib skin 
      toxicities can be affected by concurrent medications and sorafenib steady-state 
      concentrations. The described PPK model can be used to refine exposure-response 
      relations for alternative dosing strategies to minimize skin toxicity.

TI  - NABTT 0502: a phase II and pharmacokinetic study of erlotinib and sorafenib for 
      patients with progressive or recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.
PG  - 490-6
LID - 10.1093/neuonc/nos322 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The signal transduction pathways of epidermal growth factor receptor 
      and Ras are both important in the growth of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We 
      hypothesized that inhibition of both pathways would improve the survival time of 
      patients with recurrent GBM. METHODS: Patients with recurrent/progressive GBM 
      with 0-2 prior chemotherapy regimens received erlotinib 150 mg once daily and 
      sorafenib 400 mg twice daily until progression. The primary endpoint was overall 
      survival. Pharmacokinetic sampling was performed during cycle 1. RESULTS: The 
      median overall survival was 5.7 months. Progression-free survival at 6 months was 
      14%. Toxicity was manageable. Clearance of erlotinib was markedly enhanced by 
      sorafenib. CONCLUSION: The study did not meet its objective of a 30% increase in 
      overall survival time compared with historical controls. Erlotinib and sorafenib 
      have significant pharmacokinetic interactions that may negatively impact the 
      efficacy of the combination regimen.

TI  - Safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of donafenib in treating advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma: report from a phase 1b trial.
PG  - 688-693
LID - 10.1691/ph.2019.9626 [doi]
AB  - Background: Donafenib is a novel compound similar to sorafenib that functions as 
      a multikinase inhibitor. This phase 1b trial aimed to assess the safety, 
      pharmacokinetics and efficacy of donafenib in treating Chinese patients with 
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: From July 2014 to April 2015, 27 
      eligible advanced hepatocellular carcinoma patients were enrolled in the trial. 
      They were randomly divided into 200 mg and 300 mg bid groups and received these 
      oral doses of donafenib until the appearance of intolerance or disease 
      progression. Results: Overall, donafenib was safe and well tolerated in the two 
      groups, and most adverse events were grade 1 or 2. Elevated transaminase (n=19, 
      70.4 %), hypocalcemia (n=19, 70.4 %), and skin toxicity (n=17, 63.0 %) were the 
      most frequently encountered adverse events. Donafenib exhibited high variability 
      in pharmacokinetic parameters. Areas under the plasma concentration-time curve 
      from 0-12 h increased disproportionally to the dose escalation. The treatment 
      resulted in partial response in two patients and a stable disease status in 17 
      patients, and the median time to progression was 120 days for both groups. 
      Conclusion: The results from this phase 1b trial indicate a favorable safety 
      profile and notable anticancer efficacy of donafenib for treating advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. Comparable or better safety and efficacy were observed 
      for a lower dosage of donafenib compared with sorafenib in the literature.

TI  - Improving Oral Bioavailability of Sorafenib by Optimizing the "Spring" and 
      "Parachute" Based on Molecular Interaction Mechanisms.
PG  - 599-608
LID - 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.5b00837 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib is a clinically important oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor for the 
      treatment of various cancers. However, the oral bioavailability of sorafenib 
      tablet (Nexavar) is merely 38-49% relative to the oral solution, due to the low 
      aqueous solubility of sorafenib and its relatively high daily dose. It is 
      desirable to improve the oral bioavailability of sorafenib to expand the 
      therapeutic window, reduce the drug resistance, and enhance patient compliance. 
      In this study, we observed that the solubility of sorafenib could be increased 
      ∼50-fold in the coexistence of poly(vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate) (PVP-VA) and 
      sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), due to the formation of PVP-VA/SLS complexes at a 
      lower critical aggregation concentration. The enhanced solubility provided a 
      faster initial sorafenib dissolution rate, analogous to a forceful "spring" to 
      release drug into solution, from tablets containing both PVP-VA and SLS. However, 
      SLS appears to impair the ability of PVP-VA to act as an efficient "parachute" to 
      keep the drug in solution and maintain drug supersaturation. Using 2D (1)H NMR, 
      (13)C NMR, and FT-IR analysis, we concluded that the solubility enhancement and 
      supersaturation of sorafenib were achieved by PVP-VA/SLS complexes and 
      PVP-VA/sorafenib interaction, respectively, both through molecular interactions 
      hinged on the PVP-VA VA groups. Therefore, a balance between "spring" and 
      "parachute" must be carefully considered in formulation design. To confirm the in 
      vivo relevance of these molecular interaction mechanisms, we prepared three 
      tablet formulations containing PVP-VA alone, SLS alone, and PVP-VA/SLS in 
      combination. The USP II in vitro dissolution and dog pharmacokinetic in vivo 
      evaluation showed clear differentiation between these three formulations, and 
      also good in vitro-in vivo correlation. The formulation containing PVP-VA alone 
      demonstrated the best bioavailability with 1.85-fold and 1.79-fold increases in 
      Cmax and AUC, respectively, compared with the formulation containing SLS only, 
      the poorest performing one. Despite its forceful "spring", the formulation 
      containing both PVP-VA and SLS showed a moderate bioavailability enhancement, due 
      to the lack of an efficient "parachute".

TI  - A phase I trial of the oral, multikinase inhibitor sorafenib in combination with 
      carboplatin and paclitaxel.
PG  - 4836-42
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4123 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This study evaluated the safety, maximum tolerated dose, 
      pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, 
      combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with solid tumors. PATIENTS 
      AND METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with advanced cancer (24 with melanoma) 
      received oral sorafenib 100, 200, or 400 mg twice daily on days 2 to 19 of a 
      21-day cycle. All patients received carboplatin corresponding to AUC6 and 225 
      mg/m(2) paclitaxel on day 1. Pharmacokinetic analyses were done for sorafenib on 
      days 2 and 19 of cycle 1 and for paclitaxel on day 1 of cycles 1 and 2. 
      Pretreatment tumor samples from 17 melanoma patients were analyzed for BRAF 
      mutations. RESULTS: Sorafenib was well tolerated at the doses evaluated. The most 
      frequent severe adverse events were hematologic toxicities (grade 3 or 4 in 33 
      patients, 85%). Twenty-seven (69%) patients had sorafenib-related adverse events, 
      the most frequent of which were dermatologic events (26 patients, 67%). Exposure 
      to paclitaxel was not altered by intervening treatment with sorafenib. Treatment 
      with sorafenib, paclitaxel, and carboplatin resulted in one complete response and 
      nine partial responses, all among patients with melanoma. There was no 
      correlation between BRAF mutational status and treatment responses in patients 
      with melanoma. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended phase II doses are oral 400 mg twice 
      daily sorafenib, carboplatin at an AUC6 dose, and 225 mg/m(2) paclitaxel. The 
      tumor responses observed with this combined regimen in patients with melanoma 
      warrant further investigation.

TI  - The value of sorafenib trough levels in patients with advanced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma - a substudy of the SORAMIC trial.
PG  - 1028-1035
LID - 10.1080/0284186X.2020.1759826 [doi]
AB  - Background: Sorafenib for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is dose 
      adjusted by toxicity. Preliminary studies have suggested an association between 
      plasma concentrations of sorafenib and its main metabolite (M2) and clinical 
      outcomes. This study aimed to validate these findings and establish target values 
      for sorafenib trough concentrations.Methods: Patients with advanced HCC were 
      prospectively recruited within a multicenter phase II study (SORAMIC). Patients 
      with blood samples available at trough level were included for this 
      pharmacokinetic (PK) substudy. Trough plasma concentrations of sorafenib and its 
      main metabolite (M2) were associated with sorafenib-related toxicity and overall 
      survival (OS).Results: Seventy-four patients were included with a median OS of 
      19.7 months (95% CI 16.1-23.3). Patients received sorafenib for a median of 
      51 weeks (IQR 27-62) and blood samples were drawn after a median of 25 weeks (IQR 
      10-42). Patients had a median trough concentration of 3217 ng/ml (IQR 2166-4526) 
      and 360 ng/ml (IQR 190-593) with coefficients of variation of 65% and 146% for 
      sorafenib and M2, respectively. Patients who experienced severe sorafenib-related 
      toxicity received a lower average daily dose (551 vs 730 mg/day, p = .003), but 
      showed no significant differences in sorafenib (3298 vs 2915 ng/ml, p = .442) or 
      M2 trough levels (428 vs 283 ng/ml, p = .159). Trough levels of sorafenib or M2 
      showed no significant association with OS.Conclusions: In patients with advanced 
      HCC treated with sorafenib, the administered dose, trough levels of sorafenib or 
      M2, and clinical outcomes were poorly correlated. Toxicity-adjusted dosing 
      remains the standard for sorafenib treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Trebananib, an investigational peptibody, binds to angiopoietin 1 and 
      2, thereby blocking their interaction with Tie2. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This 
      open-label phase I study examined trebananib 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg intravenous 
      (I.V.) once weekly plus sorafenib 400 mg twice per day or sunitinib 50 mg once 
      per day in advanced RCC. Primary end points were adverse event incidence and 
      pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were enrolled. During trebananib 
      plus sorafenib administration (n = 17), the most common treatment-related adverse 
      events (TRAEs) included rash (n = 12; 71%), diarrhea (n = 12; 71%), hypertension 
      (n = 11; 65%), and fatigue (n = 11; 65%); grade ≥ 3 TRAEs (n = 7; 41%); and 2 
      patients (12%) had peripheral edema. During trebananib plus sunitinib 
      administration (n = 19), the most common TRAEs included diarrhea (n = 14; 74%), 
      fatigue (n = 13; 68%), hypertension (n = 11; 58%), and decreased appetite (n = 
      11; 58%); grade ≥ 3 TRAEs (n = 13; 68%); and 8 (42%) patients had peripheral 
      edema. Trebananib did not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib or 
      sunitinib. No patient developed anti-trebananib antibodies. Objective response 
      rates were 29% (trebananib plus sorafenib) and 53% (trebananib plus sunitinib). 
      CONCLUSION: The toxicities of trebananib 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg I.V. plus sorafenib 
      or sunitinib in RCC were similar to those of sorafenib or sunitinib monotherapy, 
      with peripheral edema being likely specific to the combinations. Antitumor 
      activity was observed.

TI  - Estimating the clinical risk of hypertension from VEGF signal inhibitors by a 
      non-clinical approach using telemetered rats.
PG  - 237-42
AB  - Anti-angiogenic drugs that target Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) 
      signaling pathways caused hypertension as an adverse effect in clinical studies. 
      Since the hypertension may limit the benefit provided for patients, the demand 
      for non-clinical research that predicts the clinical risk of the hypertension has 
      risen greatly. To clarify whether non-clinical research using rats can 
      appropriately estimate the clinical risk of hypertension caused by VEGF signal 
      inhibitors, we investigated the hemodynamic effects and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
      the VEGF signal inhibitors cediranib (0.1, 3, and 10 mg/kg), sunitinib (5, 10, 
      and 40 mg/kg), and sorafenib (0.1, 1, and 5 mg/kg) in telemetered rats and 
      examined the correlation between the non-clinical and the clinical hypertensive 
      effect. The VEGF signal inhibitors significantly elevated blood pressure (BP) in 
      rats within a few days of the initiation of dosing, and levels recovered after 
      dosing ended. The trend of the hypertension was similar to that in clinical 
      studies. We found that the AUC at which BP significantly increased by 
      approximately 10 mmHg in rats was comparable to the clinical AUC at which 
      moderate to severe hypertension occurred. These results represent correlations 
      between the non-clinical and the clinical hypertensive effect of VEGF signal 
      inhibitors, suggesting that non-clinical research using telemetered rats would be 
      an effective approach to predict the clinical risk of hypertension caused by VEGF 
      signal inhibitors.

TI  - A Phase 2 Study of Galunisertib (TGF-β1 Receptor Type I Inhibitor) and Sorafenib 
      in Patients With Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Inhibition of tumor growth factor-β (TGF-β) receptor type I 
      potentiated the activity of sorafenib in preclinical models of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). Galunisertib is a small-molecule selective inhibitor of TGF-β1 
      receptor type I, which demonstrated activity in a phase 2 trial as second-line 
      HCC treatment. METHODS: The combination of galunisertib and sorafenib (400 mg 
      BID) was tested in patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh A liver function 
      without prior systemic therapy. Galunisertib dose was administered 80 or 150 mg 
      b.i.d. orally for 14 days every 28 days in safety lead-in cohorts; in the 
      expansion cohort, all patients received galunisertib 150 mg b.i.d. Objectives 
      included time-to-tumor progression, changes in circulating alpha fetoprotein and 
      TGF-β1, safety, overall survival (OS), response rate, and pharmacokinetics (PK). 
      RESULTS: Patients (n = 47) were enrolled from 5 non-Asian countries; 3 and 44 
      patients received the 80 mg and 150 mg b.i.d. doses of galunisertib, 
      respectively. The pharmacokinetics and safety profiles were consistent with 
      monotherapy of each drug. For the 150 mg b.i.d. galunisertib cohort, the median 
      time-to-tumor progression was 4.1 months; the median OS was 18.8 months. A 
      partial response was seen in 2 patients, stable disease in 21, and progressive 
      disease in 13. TGF-β1 responders (decrease of >20% from baseline) vs 
      nonresponders had longer OS (22.8 vs 12.0 months, P = 0.038). DISCUSSION: The 
      combination of galunisertib and sorafenib showed acceptable safety and a 
      prolonged OS outcome.

TI  - Phase I study of sorafenib combined with radiation therapy and temozolomide as 
      first-line treatment of high-grade glioma.
PG  - 2655-61
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2014.209 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib (Sb) is a multiple kinase inhibitor targeting both tumour 
      cell proliferation and angiogenesis that may further act as a potent 
      radiosensitizer by arresting cells in the most radiosensitive cell cycle phase. 
      This phase I open-label, noncontrolled dose escalation study was performed to 
      determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Sb in combination with 
      radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) in 17 patients with newly diagnosed 
      high-grade glioma. METHODS: Patients were treated with RT (60 Gy in 2 Gy 
      fractions) combined with TMZ 75 mg m(-2) daily, and Sb administered at three dose 
      levels (200 mg daily, 200 mg BID, and 400 mg BID) starting on day 8 of RT. Thirty 
      days after the end of RT, patients received monthly TMZ (150-200 mg m(-2) 
      D1-5/28) and Sb (400 mg BID). Pharmacokinetic (PK) analyses were performed on day 
      8 (TMZ) and on day 21 (TMZ&Sb) (Clinicaltrials ID: NCT00884416). RESULTS: The MTD 
      of Sb was established at 200 mg BID. Dose-limiting toxicities included 
      thrombocytopenia (two patients), diarrhoea (one patient) and 
      hypercholesterolaemia (one patient). Sb administration did not affect the mean 
      area under the curve(0-24) and mean Cmax of TMZ and its metabolite 
      5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC). Tmax of both TMZ and AIC was delayed from 
      0.75 (TMZ alone) to 1.5 h (combined TMZ/Sb). The median progression-free survival 
      was 7.9 months (95% confidence interval (CI): 5.4-14.55), and the median overall 
      survival was 17.8 months (95% CI: 14.7-25.6). CONCLUSIONS: Although Sb can be 
      combined with RT and TMZ, significant side effects and moderate outcome results 
      do not support further clinical development in malignant gliomas. The robust PK 
      data of the TMZ/Sb combination could be useful in other cancer settings.

TI  - Sorafenib in advanced melanoma: a critical role for pharmacokinetics?
PG  - 455-61
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2012.287 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inter-patient pharmacokinetic variability can lead to suboptimal drug 
      exposure, and therefore might impact the efficacy of sorafenib. This study 
      reports long-term pharmacokinetic monitoring of patients treated with sorafenib 
      and a retrospective pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic analysis in melanoma 
      patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Heavily pretreated patients with stage IV 
      melanoma were started on sorafenib 400 mg twice daily (bid). In the absence of 
      limiting toxicity, dose escalation of 200 mg bid levels was done every 2 weeks. 
      Plasma sorafenib measurement was performed at each visit, allowing a 
      retrospective pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic analysis for safety and efficacy. 
      RESULTS: In all, 19 of 30 patients underwent dose escalation over 400 mg bid, and 
      28 were evaluable for response. The overall disease control rate was 61% (95% 
      confidence interval (CI): 42.6-78.8), including three confirmed responses (12%). 
      Disease control rate and progression-free survival (PFS) were improved in 
      patients with high vs low exposure (80% vs 32%, P=0.02, and 5.25 vs 2.5 months, 
      P=0.005, hazard ratio (HR)=0.28 (95% CI: 0.11-0.73)). In contrast, drug dosing 
      had no effect on PFS. In multivariate analysis, drug exposure was the only factor 
      associated with PFS (HR=0.36 (95% CI: 0.13-0.99)). Diarrhoea and anorexia were 
      correlated with drug dosing, while hypertension and hand-foot skin reaction were 
      correlated with drug exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Although sorafenib had modest 
      efficacy in melanoma, these results suggest a correlation between exposure and 
      efficacy of sorafenib. Therefore, dose optimisation in patients with low exposure 
      at standard doses should be evaluated in validated indications.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a fatal oncogenic disorder with few therapeutic 
      options. Novel therapeutic strategy with combination of a selective CDK4/6 
      inhibitor palbociclib (PAL) with a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) sorafenib 
      (SOR) is reported to impair tumour growth and significantly increased survival in 
      various preclinical models of HCC. In the current work a sensitive and rapid 
      UHPLC-QTOF-MS method was established for the concurrent quantification of PAL and 
      SOR in rat plasma using ibrutinib as internal standard (IS). Chromatographic 
      separation was carried out on an Agilent Poroshell EC C18 (50 mm × 3 mm, 2.7 μm) 
      using gradient mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile. Flow 
      rate of 0. 45 mL/min with a run time of 5 min was used for separation. A simple 
      sample preparation approach of protein precipitation was used in the current 
      study. The mass spectrometric analysis of selective ions at [M + H](+)m/z 
      448.2455 for PAL, m/z 465.0936 for SOR and m/z 441.2034 for IS was monitored with 
      extracted ion chromatography. The LC-MS method meets the regulatory 
      bio-analytical guidelines, exhibited good sensitivity and linearity over the 
      range of 1.0-2000.0 ng/mL for PAL and SOR. The pharmacokinetic parameters of PAL 
      remained unchanged when SOR was co-administered with PAL. The study pointed out 
      that the co-intake of PAL with SOR resulted in a slight increment of C(max)

TI  - Pharmacokinetic study of conventional sorafenib chemoembolization in a rabbit VX2 
      liver tumor model.
PG  - 235-40
LID - 10.5152/dir.2014.14394 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Use of oral sorafenib, an antiangiogenic chemotherapeutic agent for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is limited by an unfavorable side effect profile. 
      Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) employs targeted intravascular drug 
      administration, and has potential as a novel sorafenib delivery method to 
      increase tumoral concentrations and reduce systemic levels. This study aimed to 
      discern the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib TACE in a rabbit VX2 liver tumor model. 
      METHODS: A 3 mg/kg dose of sorafenib ethiodized oil emulsion was delivered via an 
      arterial catheter to VX2 liver tumors in seven New Zealand white rabbits. 
      Following TACE, serum sorafenib levels were measured at days 0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 
      and 14 until the time of sacrifice, after which rabbit livers were harvested for 
      analysis of sorafenib concentrations within treated tumors and normal liver. 
      Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used for drug quantification. 
      RESULTS: Sorafenib uptake within liver tumor and nontumorous liver tissue peaked 
      at mean 3.53 and 0.75 μg/mL, respectively, immediately post-procedure (5:1 tumor 
      to normal tissue drug uptake ratio), before decreasing with a 10-18 hour 
      half-life. Serum sorafenib levels peaked immediately after TACE at a mean value 
      of 58.58 μg/mL before normalizing with a 5.2-hour half-life, suggesting early 
      drug washout from liver into the systemic circulation. Hepatic lab parameters 
      showed transient increase 24 hours post-TACE with subsequent resolution. 
      CONCLUSION: While targeted transarterial delivery of sorafenib ethiodized oil 
      emulsion shows preferential tumor uptake compared to normal liver, systemic 
      washout occurs with a short half-life, resulting in high circulating drug levels.

TI  - Sorafenib is an inhibitor of UGT1A1 but is metabolized by UGT1A9: implications of 
      genetic variants on pharmacokinetics and hyperbilirubinemia.
PG  - 2099-107
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-11-2484 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Several case reports suggest sorafenib exposure and sorafenib-induced 
      hyperbilirubinemia may be related to a (TA)(5/6/7) repeat polymorphism in 
      UGT1A1*28 (UGT, uridine glucuronosyl transferase). We hypothesized that sorafenib 
      inhibits UGT1A1 and individuals carrying UGT1A1*28 and/or UGT1A9 variants 
      experience greater sorafenib exposure and greater increase in sorafenib-induced 
      plasma bilirubin concentration. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Inhibition of 
      UGT1A1-mediated bilirubin glucuronidation by sorafenib was assessed in vitro. 
      UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A9*3 genotypes were ascertained with fragment analysis or 
      direct sequencing in 120 cancer patients receiving sorafenib on five different 
      clinical trials. Total bilirubin measurements were collected in prostate cancer 
      patients before receiving sorafenib (n = 41) and 19 to 30 days following 
      treatment and were compared with UGT1A1*28 genotype. RESULTS: Sorafenib exhibited 
      mixed-mode inhibition of UGT1A1-mediated bilirubin glucuronidation (IC(50) = 18 
      μmol/L; K(i) = 11.7 μmol/L) in vitro. Five patients carrying UGT1A1*28/*28 (n = 
      4) or UGT1A9*3/*3 (n = 1) genotypes had first dose, dose-normalized areas under 
      the sorafenib plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) that were in the 93rd 
      percentile, whereas three patients carrying UGT1A1*28/*28 had AUCs in the bottom 
      quartile of all genotyped patients. The Drug Metabolizing Enzymes and 
      Transporters genotyping platform was applied to DNA obtained from six patients, 
      which revealed the ABCC2-24C>T genotype cosegregated with sorafenib AUC 
      phenotype. Sorafenib exposure was related to plasma bilirubin increases in 
      patients carrying 1 or 2 copies of UGT1A1*28 alleles (n = 12 and n = 5; R(2) = 
      0.38 and R(2) = 0.77; P = 0.032 and P = 0.051, respectively). UGT1A1*28 carriers 
      showed two distinct phenotypes that could be explained by ABCC2-24C>T genotype 
      and are more likely to experience plasma bilirubin increases following sorafenib 
      if they had high sorafenib exposure. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study indicates that 
      genotype status of UGT1A1, UGT1A9, and ABCC2 and serum bilirubin concentration 
      increases reflect abnormally high AUC in patients treated with sorafenib.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop and validate a robust and sensitive 
      LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous determinations of various tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors (TKIs) in biological samples and to apply the method to their 
      pharmacokinetic studies. Processed samples were injected into the UHPLC system 
      coupled to an ESI-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The compounds were 
      separated on an AcQuity UHPLC BEH C18 column (50mm×2.1mm ID, 1.7μm) using a 
      gradient elution of acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid in water. The mass analysis was 
      performed in an API 3200 Qtrap mass spectrometer via selective reaction 
      monitoring operated under a positive scanning mode. The method was validated over 
      a linear range of 3.13-800nM for erlotinib; 6.25-1600nM for sunitinib, pazopanib, 
      and axitinib; and 12.5-3200nM for sorafenib, dasatinib, lapatinib, and nilotinib, 
      respectively. The intra-day and inter-day precision were <16.7% for quality 
      control samples of the analytes at the low concentration level and <13.7% for all 
      other concentrations. The accuracy (bias) for all analytes at three different 
      concentration levels ranged from -12.2% to 15.0%. The recovery, matrix effect, 
      and stability were all in the range of acceptance. Only 10μl of blood were 
      needed, demonstrating the method's high sensitivity. The presented method was 
      shown to be suitable for the analysis of serial blood samples collected from each 
      mouse in a pharmacokinetic study, after the oral administration of 11 TKIs (each 
      at 1mg/kg) as a mixture.

PG  - 287-94
LID - 10.1007/s10637-013-9989-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This phase I trial assessed safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), dose 
      limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose (RD) of the 
      combination of sorafenib plus ifosfamide in patients with advanced sarcoma. 
      METHODS: Twelve sarcoma patients (9 soft-tissue, 3 bone sarcoma) were treated 
      with sorafenib plus ifosfamide (starting doses 200 mg bid and 6 g/m(2) 
      respectively). A 3 + 3 dose escalation design with cohorts of 3-6 patients was 
      used. A study to assess the in vitro efficacy of the combination was also 
      conducted. RESULTS: Three DLTs were observed: fatigue grade 4 with sorafenib 400 
      mg bid plus ifosfamide 6 g/m(2) and encephalopathy and emesis grade 3 with 
      sorafenib 400 mg bid plus ifosfamide 7.5 g/m(2). Other toxicities included 
      diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome, mucositis, neutropenia, skin rash and 
      thrombocytopenia. There were no relevant effects on PK of sorafenib but an 
      increase in ifosfamide active metabolite 4-hydroxy-ifosfamide was observed. Eight 
      patients achieved stable disease lasting more than 12 weeks. An additive effect 
      was observed in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: RD was sorafenib 400 mg bid plus ifosfamide 6 
      g/m(2), allowing administration of active doses of both agents. Limited 
      preliminary antitumor activity was also observed. A phase II study is currently 
      ongoing.

AB  - Sorafenib is slightly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract due to its poor 
      solubility in water. To improve its absorption, a novel nanoparticulate 
      formulation-nanomatrix was used in the study. The nanomatrix was a system 
      prepared from a porous material Sylysia(®) 350 and a pH sensitive polymer 
      Eudragit(®). The formulations were optimized by orthogonal design (L(9)(3(4))) 
      and their bioavailability were evaluated in rat, comparing to pH-sensitive 
      Eudragit nanoparticles and suspension of sorafenib. In the formulations, the 
      ratio of sorafenib to Eudragit(®) S100 was found to be more important determinant 
      of the sorafenib bioavailability than the ratio of sorafenib to Sylysia(®) 350. 
      As for the bioavailability, the AUC(0-36 h) of sorafenib nanomatrix was 13-33 
      times to that of sorafenib suspension, but only 16.8% to 40.8% that of 
      Eudragit(®) S100 nanoparticles. This may be resulted from the different drug 
      dispersion degree, release character and bioadhension activity. However, because 
      all the materials used in the nanomatrix formulation are commonly adjuvant, safe, 
      easy to get and cheap, above all, the nanomatrix formulation can solve the 
      stability and scaling up problems in the nanoparticles, it had potential to 
      develop into a product in the future.

      castration-resistant prostate cancer.
PG  - 592-7
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2012.312 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose-limiting 
      toxicity (DLT) of sorafenib (S) plus imatinib (IM) in castration-resistant 
      prostate cancer (CRPC) patients. METHODS: Refractory CRPC patients were enrolled 
      onto this 3+3 dose escalation designed study. Imatinib pharmacokinetics (PK) were 
      determined on day 15, 4 h post dose with a validated LC-MS assay. RESULTS: 
      Seventeen patients were enrolled; 10 evaluable (6 at 400 mg S qd with 300 mg IM 
      qd (DL0) and 4 at 400 mg S bid with 300 mg IM qd (DL1)); inevaluable patients 
      received <1 cycle. The median age was 73 (57-89); median prostatic serum antigen 
      was 284 ng ml(-1) (11.7-9027). Median number of prior non-hormonal therapies was 
      3 (1-12). Dose-limiting toxicities were diarrhoea and hand-foot syndrome. Maximum 
      tolerated dose was 400 mg S and 300 mg IM both daily. No biochemical responses 
      were observed. Two patients had stable disease by RECIST. Median time to 
      progression was 2 months (1-5). Median OS was 6 months (1-30+) with 3/17 patients 
      (17%) alive at 21 months median follow-up. Ten patients had PK data suggesting 
      that S reduced IM clearance by 55%, resulting in 77% increased exposure (P=0.005; 
      compared with historical data). CONCLUSION: This is the first report showing that 
      S+IM can be administered in CRPC at a dose of 400 mg S and 300 mg IM, daily.

AB  - Delivery of hydrophobic drugs is a significant challenge due to poor solubility 
      and formulation difficulty. Here, we describe the potential of ionic liquids, in 
      particular choline and geranic acid (CAGE), for oral delivery of a hydrophobic 
      drug, sorafenib (SRF). CAGE provided excellent apparent solubility of SRF 
      tosylate (> 500 mg/mL). Upon oral dosing in rats, CAGE increased peak blood 
      concentrations of SRF by 2.2-fold. The elimination half-life of SRF was also 
      increased by 2-fold and the mean absorption time was extended by 1.6-fold. 
      Furthermore, SRF delivered by CAGE exhibited significantly different 
      biodistribution compared to control formulations. Specifically, accumulation in 
      lungs and kidneys improved 4.4-fold and 6.2-fold, respectively compared to 
      control formulations. Mechanistic studies revealed that SRF-CAGE solution 
      spontaneously formed a self-assembled structure (427 ± 41 nm), which is likely 
      responsible for altered biodistribution in vivo. UPLC-MS studies confirmed the 
      presence of choline-geranate species in blood indicative of micellar/emulsion 
      structures which eventually dissociated into choline and geranic acid molecular 
      species. These studies provide a simple, scalable strategy for oral delivery of 
      hydrophobic drugs.

LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-10-0503 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Heat shock protein (Hsp) 90 inhibition affects the Raf kinase signaling 
      pathway and could enhance antitumor effects of sorafenib, a Raf kinase inhibitor. 
      The combination of sorafenib and tanespimycin [17-allyl-amino-geldanamycin 
      (17-AAG); NSC 330507/KOS-953] was evaluated in a phase I trial with the primary 
      objective of defining a phase II dose. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The dose cohorts 
      consisted of fixed continuous oral dosing of 400 mg sorafenib twice daily, 
      starting at 14 days before tanespimycin, which was administered intravenously at 
      escalating doses (starting at 300 mg/m,(2) with 50 mg/m(2) increments), on days 
      1, 8, and 15 in a 28-day cycle. Toxicity was assessed weekly, and response was 
      evaluated every two cycles. RESULTS: Twenty-seven toxicity-evaluable patients 
      were enrolled and treated at four dose levels. Predominant primary malignancies 
      were renal cancer (12), melanoma (6), and colorectal cancer (4). Dose-limiting 
      toxicities of grade 4 transaminitis and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome in one patient 
      each were observed at 450 mg/m(2) of tanespimycin. One hundred fourteen cycles 
      were administered with a median of four cycles (range 1-17 cycles). Plasma 
      concentrations of sorafenib and metabolites reached steady state after 7 days. 
      Tanespimycin did not alter sorafenib concentrations. Pharmacodynamics showed a 
      decrease in Hsp90 levels and induction of Hsp70. Clinical efficacy was observed 
      in 9 of 12 renal cancer patients and 4 of 6 melanoma patients CONCLUSIONS: 
      Recommended phase II doses of this combination are 400 mg sorafenib twice daily 
      and 400 mg/m(2) tanespimycin on days 1, 8, and 15, every 28 days. Clinical and 
      pharmacodynamic activity was observed in kidney cancer and melanoma.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic interaction involving sorafenib and the calcium-channel blocker 
      felodipine in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 1511-4
LID - 10.1007/s10637-010-9514-3 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib, an orally active multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is primarily metabolized both via cytochrome P450 
      3A4 isoform (CYP3A4) and UGT1A9. Due to the contribution of these two 
      biotransformation pathways, sorafenib is considered to be less susceptible than 
      other agents to CYP3A4 drug-drug interactions. This report discusses a clinically 
      relevant pharmacokinetic CYP3A4 drug-drug interaction between sorafenib and 
      felodipine in an 80-year-old Caucasian patient with HCC. On day 15, after the 
      introduction of sorafenib (400 mg bid), sorafenib plasma concentration was at 
      3.6 mg/L. Felodipine (5 mg bid), an anti-hypertensive agent that is exclusively 
      CYP3A4 substrate, was then introduced due to grade 2 sorafenib-related 
      hypertension. On day 30, hypertension was well controlled. However, sorafenib 
      plasma concentration was 3-fold greater (11.4 mg/L) and the patient experienced 
      grade-3 anorexia. Since neither diarrhea nor cutaneous side effects were noticed 
      at this time, sorafenib treatment was continued at the same daily dosage. On day 
      45, sorafenib plasma concentration was stable (10.8 mg/L) before declining on 
      days 60 and 75 (7.0 mg/L and 7.4 mg/L, respectively), which was probably related 
      to an occurrence of grade-2 diarrhea. This observation suggests a pharmacokinetic 
      interaction involving CYP3A4 inhibition by felodipine. According to the Drug 
      Interaction Probability Scale, this interaction was possible. Since hypertension 
      is a common toxicity of sorafenib, clinicians should be aware of this possible 
      interaction. The clinical relevance of pharmacokinetic interactions involving 
      CYP3A4 inhibition in HCC patients receiving sorafenib is analyzed in this case 
      report.

TI  - Phase I trial of sorafenib in combination with gefitinib in patients with 
      refractory or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer.
PG  - 2684-91
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the combination of sorafenib and gefitinib in patients with 
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this dose-escalation 
      trial, patients received oral sorafenib (200-400 mg) twice daily with gefitinib 
      (250 mg orally) once daily to identify the recommended dose for phase II trials 
      (RDP; part A). The pharmacokinetics of the RDP were characterized further in 
      additional patients (part B) receiving single-agent gefitinib or sorafenib for 21 
      days followed by a 7-day washout with crossover to the other agent for an 
      additional 21 days. Patients then received the combination of sorafenib plus 
      gefitinib in 28-day cycles. Safety, pharmacokinetics, and antitumor efficacy were 
      evaluated. Potential drug-drug interactions and the relationship between 
      pharmacokinetics and toxicity were also assessed. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients 
      were treated (n=12, part A; n=19, part B). Most adverse events were grade 1/2. 
      The most frequent grade 3/4 events included diarrhea and elevated alanine 
      aminotransferase (both 9.7%). One dose-limiting toxicity occurred (part A: 
      elevated alanine aminotransferase at 400 mg twice daily). Gefitinib had no effect 
      on sorafenib pharmacokinetics. However, gefitinib C(max) (26%) and area under the 
      curve (38%) were reduced by concomitant sorafenib. One patient had a partial 
      response; 20 (65%; n=8, part A; n=12, part B) had stable disease >or=4 months. 
      The RDP was sorafenib 400 mg twice daily with gefitinib 250 mg once daily. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib combined with gefitinib is well tolerated, with promising 
      efficacy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Studies to further 
      investigate the significance of the reduction in gefitinib exposure by sorafenib 
      are warranted.

TI  - A drug interaction study evaluating the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of 
      sorafenib in combination with capecitabine.
PG  - 137-44
LID - 10.1007/s00280-011-1674-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To address tolerability and a possible pharmacologic interaction of 
      capecitabine with sorafenib. METHODS: Patients with advanced solid tumors (ECOG 
      PS 0-1) were included. Cohort A received capecitabine 750 mg/m(2) BID and Cohort 
      B received capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) BID, both for 14 days of a 21-day cycle. 
      Steady-state PK was obtained for capecitabine alone, sorafenib alone, and in 
      combination. Cohort C explored an alternate schedule of 7-day on/7-day off flat 
      dose capecitabine 1,000 mg BID with continuous dosing of sorafenib 400 mg BID. 
      RESULTS: A total of 32 patients were enrolled between February 08 and April 09. 
      Hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) was the primary toxicity with 16 (50%) of the 32 
      patients experiencing grade 3 events (75% occurring during cycles 1-2). Grade 3 
      HFSR defined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Cohort C at 1,000 mg BID flat 
      dose of capecitabine. Other grade 3/4 toxicities were rare (diarrhea 6%, 
      mucositis 3%, and fatigue 3%). Capecitabine did not change the C (max) or 
      AUC((0-12)) of sorafenib. Co-administration of sorafenib with capecitabine 
      750 mg/m(2) (n = 6 patients) increased capecitabine AUC((0-12)) 15% and produced 
      no change in the 5FU AUC((0-12)). At the capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) dose level 
      (n = 12 pts), there was a 16% increase in capecitabine AUC((0-12)) and an 8% 
      increase in 5FU AUC((0-12)). However, these trends were not statistically 
      significant. CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of sorafenib resulted in a mild 
      increase in capecitabine AUC, although not statistically significant. 
      Capecitabine did not affect the exposure of sorafenib. The rate of grade 3 HFSR 
      is concerning and limits the feasibility of prolonged dosing of sorafenib with 
      capecitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) on the 21-day schedule.

TI  - Sorafenib in a hepatocellular carcinoma patient with end-stage renal failure: A 
      pharmacokinetic study.
PG  - 685-8
LID - 10.1111/hepr.12156 [doi]
AB  - The efficacy of sorafenib against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been 
      extensively reported. However, there is little information available about the 
      use of sorafenib for HCC patients with end-stage renal failure. We herein report 
      the safe introduction of sorafenib therapy for a HCC patient on hemodialysis. A 
      63-year-old man had received multidisciplinary treatments, including 
      transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and radiofrequency ablation, for HCC since 
      1996, and had been undergoing hemodialysis since 2005. He also underwent TACE for 
      multiple liver recurrence of HCC in 2011. Sorafenib therapy (200 mg/day) started 
      8 days after the TACE. The pharmacokinetic parameters of sorafenib and its active 
      metabolite, M-2, were within the reference levels observed in patients with 
      normal renal function 8 and 9 days after the initiation of sorafenib. The dose of 
      sorafenib was reduced to 200 mg every other day on day 154 due to hypertension 
      and general fatigue. Because of the progression of disease after 5 months, 
      sorafenib was withdrawn on day 180. He was admitted to the emergency department 
      because of a high fever during hemodialysis on day 201, and died of septic shock 
      induced by Staphylococcus lugdunensis on day 203. Sorafenib was well tolerated at 
      an initial dose of 200 mg/day for a HCC patient undergoing hemodialysis, thus 
      indicating that renal failure is not necessarily a contraindication for sorafenib 
      therapy.

TI  - Pediatric phase I trial of oral sorafenib and topotecan in refractory or 
      recurrent pediatric solid malignancies.
PG  - 294-303
LID - 10.1002/cam4.598 [doi]
AB  - Targeted kinase inhibitors and camptothecins have shown preclinical and clinical 
      activity in several cancers. This trial evaluated the maximum tolerated dose 
      (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities of sorafenib and topotecan administered orally 
      in pediatric patients with relapsed solid tumors. Sorafenib was administered 
      twice daily and topotecan once daily on days 1-5 and 8-12 of each 28-day course. 
      The study utilized a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design. Three dose levels 
      (DL) were evaluated: (1) sorafenib 150 mg/m(2) and topotecan 1 mg/m(2) ; (2) 
      sorafenib 150 mg/m(2) and topotecan 1.4 mg/m(2) ; and (3) sorafenib 200 mg/m(2) 
      and topotecan 1.4 mg/m(2) . Pharmacokinetics were ascertained and treatment 
      response assessed. Thirteen patients were enrolled. DL2 was the determined MTD. 
      Grade 4 thrombocytopenia delaying therapy for >7 days was observed in one of six 
      patients on DL2, and grade 4 neutropenia that delayed therapy in two of three 
      patients on DL3. A patient with preexisting cardiac failure controlled with 
      medication developed a transient drop in the left ventricular ejection fraction 
      that improved when sorafenib was withheld. Sorafenib exposure with or without 
      topotecan was comparable, and the concentration-time profiles for topotecan alone 
      and in combination with sorafenib were similar. One objective response was noted 
      in a patient with fibromatosis. We determined MTD to be sorafenib 150 mg/m(2) 
      twice daily orally on days 1-28 combined with topotecan 1.4 mg/m(2) once daily on 
      days 1-5 and 8-12. While these doses are 1 DL below the MTD of the agents 
      individually, pharmacokinetic studies suggested adequate drug exposure without 
      drug interactions. The combination had limited activity in the population 
      studied.

TI  - In vitro to in vivo comparison of the substrate characteristics of sorafenib 
      tosylate toward P-glycoprotein.
PG  - 1341-6
LID - 10.1124/dmd.110.032052 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib (Nexavar) is a novel oral Raf kinase and vascular endothelial growth 
      factor receptor inhibitor. Most anticancer drugs are substrates for ATP-binding 
      cassette efflux pumps especially for P-glycoprotein (P-gp). To evaluate the 
      influence of P-gp on the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib substrate properties for 
      this transporter were investigated. Therefore, permeability of sorafenib across 
      Caco-2 and P-gp-overexpressing cells was determined. To determine the in vivo 
      relevance of these in vitro findings, pharmacokinetics of sorafenib in 
      mdr1a/1b(-/-) and wild-type (WT) mice was studied. Sorafenib is highly permeable 
      and exhibits a slight efflux across Caco-2 cells. In P-gp-overexpressing cells, a 
      small concentration-dependent efflux was observed, which was completely blocked 
      by the addition of ivermectin. In mdr1a/1b(-/-) and WT mice, unchanged compound 
      represented by far the majority of radioactivity in plasma. After intravenous and 
      oral administration, brain/plasma concentration ratios in mdr1a/1b(-/-) mice were 
      1.3- to 1.5-fold higher than those in WT mice. However, after intravenous or oral 
      administration, plasma concentrations were similar in both mouse strains. In 
      conclusion, sorafenib is highly permeable and a weak P-gp substrate in vitro. 
      These findings were confirmed by the small factor of 1.3 to 1.5 observed for the 
      brain/plasma ratios in mdr1a/1b(-/-) versus WT mice in vivo. Based on these in 
      vitro and in vivo results, it is unlikely that P-gp has a major effect on the 
      plasma concentrations of sorafenib in humans. Because of the high permeability 
      and low P-gp-mediated transport, sorafenib might be able to cross the blood-brain 
      barrier and target tumors within the brain.

TI  - Phase I targeted combination trial of sorafenib and erlotinib in patients with 
      advanced solid tumors.
PG  - 4849-57
AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib and erlotinib are potent, orally administered receptor 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors with antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activities. 
      Given their inhibitory target profile and efficacy as single agents, the 
      combination of these drugs is of considerable interest in solid malignancies. 
      This study aimed to determine the recommended phase II dose of this targeted 
      combination, their toxicity profile, pharmacokinetic interaction, and preliminary 
      clinical activities. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Sorafenib was administered alone for a 
      1-week run-in period, and then both drugs were given together continuously, with 
      every 28 days considered as a cycle. Three dose levels were assessed. RESULTS: 
      Seventeen patients with advanced solid tumors received 75 cycles of treatment. 
      The most frequent adverse events of all grades were constitutional and 
      gastrointestinal in nature followed by electrolytes and dermatologic toxicities. 
      Fatigue was the most common adverse event (17 patients; 100%) followed by 
      diarrhea (15 patients; 88%), hypophosphatemia (13 patients; 76%), and acneiform 
      rash (12 patients; 71%). These adverse events were predominantly mild to 
      moderate. The recommended phase II dose of this combination was determined as 400 
      mg twice daily sorafenib and 150 mg daily erlotinib. Pharmacokinetic analysis 
      revealed no significant effect of erlotinib on the pharmacokinetic profile of 
      sorafenib. Among 15 evaluable patients, 3 (20%) achieved a confirmed partial 
      response and 9 (60%) had stable disease as best response. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib 
      and erlotinib are well tolerated and seem to have no pharmacokinetic interactions 
      when administered in combination at their full single-agent recommended doses. 
      This well tolerated combination resulted in promising activity that needs further 
      validation in phase II studies.

TI  - Phase I trial of sorafenib in combination with IFN alpha-2a in patients with 
      unresectable and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma or malignant melanoma.
PG  - 1801-9
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics, and 
      efficacy, and to evaluate biomarkers, of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib plus 
      IFN alpha-2a in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) or melanoma. EXPERIMENTAL 
      DESIGN: Patients received 28-day cycles of continuous, oral sorafenib twice daily 
      and s.c. IFN thrice weekly: sorafenib 200 mg twice daily plus IFN 6 million IU 
      (MIU) thrice weekly (cohort 1); and sorafenib 400 mg twice daily plus IFN 6 MIU 
      thrice weekly (cohort 2); or plus IFN 9 MIU thrice weekly (cohort 3). Tumor 
      response was assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and dynamic 
      contrast-enhanced ultrasonography. RESULTS: Thirteen patients received at least 
      one dose of sorafenib plus IFN (12 RCC; one melanoma). The maximum tolerated dose 
      was not reached [only one dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 asthenia)]. Most 
      frequently reported drug-related adverse events were grade 2 or less in severity, 
      including fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, alopecia, and hand-foot skin reaction. One 
      (7.7%) RCC patient achieved partial response and eight (61.5%) had stable disease 
      (including the melanoma patient). Good responders assessed by dynamic 
      contrast-enhanced ultrasonography had increased progression-free survival and 
      overall survival, relative to poor responders. IFN had no effect on the 
      pharmacokinetics of sorafenib. There were no significant changes in absolute 
      values of lymphocytes, levels of proangiogenic cytokines, or inhibition of 
      phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase in T cells or natural killer 
      cells, with combination therapy. CONCLUSIONS: This sorafenib combination was well 
      tolerated, with preliminary antitumor activity in advanced RCC and melanoma 
      patients. There were no drug-drug interactions and the recommended dose for 
      future studies is sorafenib 400 mg twice daily plus IFN 9 MIU.

TI  - Herb-Drug Interaction between the Traditional Hepatoprotective Formulation and 
      Sorafenib on Hepatotoxicity, Histopathology and Pharmacokinetics in Rats.
LID - 10.3390/molecules22071034 [doi]
LID - 1034
AB  - Sorafenib has been used as a standard therapy for advanced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). In Asia, patients with HCC are potentially treated with the 
      combination of sorafenib and Chinese herbal medicines to improve the efficiency 
      and reduce the side effects of sorafenib. However, limited information about the 
      herb-drug interactions is available. We hypothesize that the Chinese herbal 
      medicine may exert hepatoprotective effects on the sorafenib-treated group. The 
      aim of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetic mechanism of drug-drug 
      interactions of sorafenib including interacting with hepatoprotective 
      formulation, Long-Dan-Xie-Gan-Tang formulation (LDXGT) and with two cytochrome 
      P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitors, grapefruit juice and ketoconazole. Liver enzyme 
      levels and histopathology of liver slices were used to evaluate sorafenib-induced 
      hepatotoxicity and the potential hepatoprotective effects of the LDXGT 
      formulation on subjects treated with the combination of sorafenib and the herbal 
      medicine. In this study, a validated HPLC-photodiode array analytical system was 
      developed for the pharmacokinetic study of sorafenib in rats. As the result of 
      the pharmacokinetic data, pretreatment with the LDXGT formulation did not 
      significantly interact with sorafenib compared with sorafenib oral administration 
      alone. Furthermore, grapefruit juice and ketoconazole did not significantly 
      affect sorafenib metabolism. Furthermore, pretreatment with variable, single or 
      repeat doses of the LDXGT formulation did not suppress or exacerbate the 
      sorafenib-induced hepatotoxicity and histopathological alterations. According to 
      these results, the LDXGT formulation is safe, but has no beneficial effects on 
      sorafenib-induced hepatotoxicity. A detailed clinical trial should be performed 
      to further evaluate the efficacy or adverse effects of the LDXGT formulation in 
      combination with sorafenib in humans.

AB  - WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT: Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor 
      with activity against B-raf, C-raf, VEGFR2, PDGFRβ and FGFR1. Sorafenib is 
      clinically approved for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The pharmacokinetics (PK) of sorafenib are highly 
      variable between subjects. Sorafenib exposure increases less than dose 
      proportionally (likely due to limited solubility). Sorafenib undergoes 
      enterohepatic recycling (EHC). WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This is the first study to 
      characterize the PK of sorafenib using a model based on sorafenib's known 
      disposition characteristics such as delayed/solubility-limited GI absorption and 
      EHC. The parameterization of the EHC model used a square wave function to 
      describe the gall bladder emptying. This study evaluated the effect of baseline 
      bodyweight, BSA, age, gender, liver function parameters, kidney function 
      parameters and genotype with respect to CYP3A4*1B, CYP3A5*3C, UGT1A9*3 and 
      UGT1A9*5 on sorafenib PK. No clinically important covariates were identified. 
      This model can be used to simulate and explore alternative dosing regimens and to 
      develop exposure-response relationships for sorafenib. AIMS: To characterize the 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of sorafenib in patients with solid tumours and to evaluate 
      the possible effects of demographic, clinical and pharmacogenetic (CYP3A4*1B, 
      CYP3A5*3C, UGT1A9*3 and UGT1A9*5) covariates on the disposition of sorafenib. 
      METHODS: PK were assessed in 111 patients enrolled in five phase I and II 
      clinical trials, where sorafenib 200 or 400 mg was administered twice daily as a 
      single agent or in combination therapy. All patients were genotyped for 
      polymorphisms in metabolic enzymes for sorafenib. Population PK analysis was 
      performed by using nonlinear mixed effects modelling (NONMEM). The final model 
      was validated using visual predictive checks and nonparametric bootstrap 
      analysis. RESULTS: A one compartment model with four transit absorption 
      compartments and enterohepatic circulation (EHC) adequately described sorafenib 
      disposition. Baseline bodyweight was a statistically significant covariate for 
      distributional volume, accounting for 4% of inter-individual variability (IIV). 
      PK model parameter estimates (range) for an 80 kg patient were clearance 8.13 l 
      h(-1) (3.6-22.3 l h(-1) ), volume 213 l (50-1000 l), mean absorption transit time 
      1.98 h (0.5-13 h), fraction undergoing EHC 50% and average time to gall bladder 
      emptying 6.13 h. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, population PK analysis was consistent with 
      known biopharmaceutical/PK characteristics of oral sorafenib. No clinically 
      important PK covariates were identified.

      hepatocellular carcinoma: Implications for combination trials.
PG  - 2476-2488

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sorafenib and lenvatinib are the first-line treatments 
      approved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but information is lacking about the 
      relationships between their pharmacokinetics, patients pharmacogenetic profiles, 
      adverse events (AE) and overall survival. We aimed to elucidate these 
      relationships of tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors, such as sorafenib, in order to 
      improve the design of trials testing it in combination with checkpoint 
      inhibitors. METHODS: We assessed the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib and its 
      N-oxide metabolite at day-0, day-7, day-30, day-60, day-90, day-120, day-150 and 
      day-180 and nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in five genes related to 
      sorafenib metabolism/transport to identify the best point for starting the 
      combination between tyrosine kinases and checkpoint inhibitors. RESULTS: We 
      prospectively included 49 patients (96% cirrhotic, 37% hepatitis-C, 82% 
      Child-Pugh-A and 59% BCLC-C). Pharmacokinetic values peaked at day-7 and 
      progressively declined until day-60. In the 16 patients without further dose 
      modifications after day-60, pharmacokinetic values remained stable through 
      day-180 (sorafenib P = .90; N-oxide P = .93). Pharmacokinetic values were higher 
      in patients with early dermatological adverse events and lower in patients with 
      early diarrhoea. Sorafenib and N-oxide pharmacokinetic values varied linearly 
      with different alleles of MRP2*3972. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib's pharmacokinetics is 
      heterogeneous across HCC patients. This heterogeneity affects adverse events 
      development and must be taken into account in setting the dose and timing of its 
      combination with checkpoint inhibitors.

LID - 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-09-0868 [doi]
AB  - The aims of this study were to further define the safety of sorafenib and 
      erlotinib, given at their full approved monotherapy doses, and to correlate 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic markers with clinical outcome. In addition, a 
      novel pharmacodynamic marker based on the real-time measurement of RAF signal 
      transduction capacity (STC) is described. Sorafenib was administered alone for a 
      1-week run-in period, and then both drugs were given together continuously. RAF 
      STC was assessed in peripheral blood monocytes prior to erlotinib initiation. 
      Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and K-RAS mutations were 
      measured in archival tumor samples. Changes in pERK and CD31 were determined in 
      fresh tumor biopsies obtained pretreatment, prior to erlotinib dosing, and during 
      the administration of both drugs. In addition, positron emission 
      tomography-computed tomography scans and pharmacokinetic assessments were done. 
      Eleven patients received a total of 57 cycles (median, 5; range, 1-10). Only four 
      patients received full doses of both drugs for the entire study course, with 
      elevation of liver enzymes being the main reason for dose reductions and delays. 
      Among 10 patients evaluable for response, 8 experienced tumor stabilization of 
      >or=4 cycles. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no significant interaction of 
      erlotinib with sorafenib. Sorafenib-induced decrease in RAF-STC showed 
      statistically significant correlation with time-to-progression in seven patients. 
      Other pharmacodynamic markers did not correlate with clinical outcome. This drug 
      combination resulted in promising clinical activity in solid tumor patients 
      although significant toxicity warrants close monitoring. RAF-STC deserves further 
      study as a predictive marker for sorafenib.

TI  - Phase I trial and pharmacokinetic study of sorafenib in children with 
      neurofibromatosis type I and plexiform neurofibromas.
PG  - 396-401
LID - 10.1002/pbc.24281 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib targets multiple pathways thought to be crucial in growth 
      of plexiform neurofibroma (PN) in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). 
      Sorafenib has been tolerated with manageable toxicities in adults and children 
      with refractory cancer. We conducted a separate study in this population. 
      Monitoring long-term toxicities such as effects on growth and obtaining 
      additional pharmacokinetic data were of importance due to the young age and long 
      duration of therapy seen in previous phase I trials in children with NF1. 
      PROCEDURE: Children ≥3 and ≤18-year-old with NF1 and inoperable PN were eligible. 
      Sorafenib was administered orally twice daily for consecutive 28-day cycles. 
      Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined from toxicities observed during the 
      first three cycles. RESULTS: Nine children enrolled, median age 8 (6-12) years. 
      At the starting 115 mg/m(2) /dose (n = 5), two experienced dose-limiting grade 3 
      pain in their PN. At the de-escalated 80 mg/m(2) /dose (n = 4), approximately 40% 
      of the pediatric solid tumor MTD, two had dose-limiting toxicity (grade 3 rash 
      and grade 4 mood alteration), exceeding the MTD. At 80 mg/m(2) /dose, the median 
      AUC(0-12 hours) at steady-state was 39.5 µg hours/ml. Toxicities appeared to 
      correspond with decreases in quality of life (QOL). No tumor shrinkage was 
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: Children with NF1 and PN did not tolerate sorafenib at 
      doses substantially lower than the MTD in children and adults with malignant 
      solid tumors. Future trials with targeted agents for children with NF1 may 
      require a more conservative starting dose and separate definitions of dose 
      limiting toxicities (DLT) than children with cancer.

TI  - Sarcopenia predicts early dose-limiting toxicities and pharmacokinetics of

PG  - e37563

LID - e37563
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib induces frequent dose limiting toxicities (DLT) in patients 
      with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sarcopenia has been associated with 
      poor performance status and shortened survival in cancer patients. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: The characteristics of Child Pugh A cirrhotic patients with HCC 
      receiving sorafenib in our institution were retrospectively analyzed. Sorafenib 
      plasma concentrations were determined at each visit. Toxicities were recorded 
      during the first month of treatment, and sarcopenia was determined from baseline 
      CT-scans. RESULTS: Forty patients (30 males) were included. Eleven (27.5%) were 
      sarcopenic. Eighteen patients (45%) experienced a DLT during the first month of 
      treatment. Sarcopenic patients experienced significantly more DLTs than 
      non-sarcopenic patients did (82% versus 31%, p = 0.005). Grade 3 diarrhea was 
      significantly more frequent in sarcopenic patients than in non-sarcopenic 
      patients (45.5% versus 6.9%, p = 0.01), but not grade 3 hand foot syndrome 
      reaction (9% versus 17.2%, p = 1). On day 28, median sorafenib AUC (n = 17) was 
      significantly higher in sarcopenic patients (102.4 mg/l.h versus 53.7 mg/l.h, p = 
      0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Among cirrhotic Child Pugh A patients with advanced HCC, 
      sarcopenia predicts sorafenib exposure and the occurrence of DLT within the first 
      month of treatment.

TI  - Results of a phase I trial of sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) in combination with 
      oxaliplatin in patients with refractory solid tumors, including colorectal 
      cancer.
PG  - 188-96
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006), a multiple kinase inhibitor, has been shown 
      to inhibit tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis by targeting Raf kinase, vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptor, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. 
      In phase I studies, sorafenib demonstrated single-agent activity in patients with 
      advanced solid tumors and was successfully combined with oxaliplatin in 
      preclinical studies. This phase I study investigated the safety, 
      pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of sorafenib in combination with oxaliplatin. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with refractory solid tumors were 
      enrolled in the initial dose-escalation part (cohorts 1, 2A, and 2B) and 10 
      additional patients with oxaliplatin-refractory colorectal cancer were 
      subsequently enrolled in an extension part (cohort 3). Oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 was 
      given on day 1 of a 3-week cycle and oral sorafenib was administered continuously 
      from day 4 of cycle 1 at 200 mg twice daily (cohort 1) or 400 mg twice daily 
      (cohorts 2A, 2B, and 3). RESULTS: Adverse events were generally mild to moderate 
      and the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Common adverse events were 
      diarrhea (52% of patients in the dose-escalation part and 20% in the extension 
      part), sensory neuropathy (44% and 20%), and dermatologic toxicities (41% and 
      80%). No pharmacokinetic interaction between sorafenib and oxaliplatin was 
      detectable. Two patients with gastric cancer had a partial response. Forty-three 
      percent of patients in cohorts 1 and 2A/B and 78% of patients in cohort 3 
      exhibited stable disease for >or=10 weeks. CONCLUSION: Continuous oral sorafenib 
      400 mg twice daily was safely combined with oxaliplatin without detectable drug 
      interactions and showed preliminary antitumor activity in this phase I study. 
      This dose is recommended for phase II studies.

TI  - Phase I and clinical pharmacology study of bevacizumab, sorafenib, and low-dose 
      cyclophosphamide in children and young adults with refractory/recurrent solid 
      tumors.
PG  - 236-46
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-12-1897 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities 
      (DLT), pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of sorafenib, bevacizumab, and 
      low-dose oral cyclophosphamide in children and young adults with 
      recurrent/refractory solid tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Sorafenib dose was 
      escalated from 90 to 110 mg/m(2) twice daily with fixed doses of bevacizumab at 5 
      mg/kg every 3 weeks and cyclophosphamide at 50 mg/m(2) daily. Once sorafenib's 
      MTD was established, bevacizumab dose was escalated. Each course was of 21 days. 
      Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics studies were conducted during the first 
      course. RESULTS: Nineteen patients (11 males; median age, 9.2 years) received a 
      median of four courses (range, 1-23). DLTs during course 1 included grade 3 rash 
      (two), increased lipase (one), anorexia (one), and thrombus (one). With an 
      additional 71 courses of therapy, the most common toxicities ≥ grade 3 included 
      neutropenia (nine), lymphopenia (nine), and rashes (four). Five of 17 evaluable 
      patients had partial tumor responses, and five had disease stabilization (>2 
      courses). Median day 1 cyclophosphamide apparent oral clearance was 3.13 
      L/h/m(2). Median day 1 sorafenib apparent oral clearance was 44 and 39 
      mL/min/m(2) at the 2 dose levels evaluated, and steady-state concentrations 
      ranged from 1.64 to 4.8 mg/L. Inhibition of serum VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) was 
      inversely correlated with sorafenib steady-state concentrations (P = 0.019). 
      CONCLUSION: The recommended phase II doses are sorafenib, 90 mg/m(2) twice daily; 
      bevacizumab, 15 mg/kg q3 weeks; and cyclophosphamide, 50 mg/m(2) once daily. This 
      regimen is feasible with promising evidence of antitumor activity that warrants 
      further investigation.

TI  - Improved Oral Bioavailability and Liver Targeting of Sorafenib Solid Lipid 
      Nanoparticles in Rats.

AB  - Minimal information is available on the oral bioavailability and liver-targeting 
      properties of sorafenib solid lipid nanoparticles (SRF-SLNs) in rats. In this 
      study, SRF-SLNs were prepared via the combined methods of high-speed shearing and 
      ultrasonic treatment. SRF-SLN formulations were also optimized. Particle size, 
      zeta potential, entrapment efficiency (EE), and drug loading (DL) were used as 
      indices for the evaluation of the as-prepared SRF-SLNs. SRF concentration was 
      determined by the high-performance liquid chromatography method. Results showed 
      that the average EE and DL of SRF-SLNs were 89.87 and 5.39%. The average particle 
      size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential of SRF-SLNs were 77.16 nm, 0.28, 
      and - 18.1 mV, respectively. The results of the stability test showed that 
      SRF-SLNs remained stable for more than 1 month at room temperature. After oral 
      administration to rats (7.5 mg/kg), the liver-targeting evaluation results showed 
      that the average drug selectivity index value of SRF-SLNs was 2.20 times higher, 
      than that of the SRF-suspension. Furthermore, the area under the 
      concentration-time curve of SRF increased by 66.7% in the SRF-SLN group comparing 
      with that in the SRF-suspension. Our results suggested that SLNs were a promising 
      approach for the oral delivery of SRF.

TI  - A phase Ib study of selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) in combination with 
      sorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
PG  - 2210-2215
LID - 10.1093/annonc/mdw415 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment with sorafenib, although associated with inhibition of 
      tumour growth and angiogenesis in in vivo studies, leads to up-regulation of 
      pERK. The addition of MEK inhibition could potentially abrogate this effect and 
      potentiate anti-tumour activity. This phase I study investigated the maximum 
      tolerated dose (MTD), safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and biomarker 
      correlates of selumetinib combined with sorafenib in patients with advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: Patients with Child-Pugh (CP) score ≤7 
      were treated with 400 mg twice daily of sorafenib with escalating doses of 
      selumetinib in a 3 + 3 study design. The dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) evaluation 
      period was 28 days. PK of selumetinib was determined. Angiogenic effect was 
      evaluated with dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). 
      RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients of Asian ethnicity were enrolled. The MTD was 
      selumetinib 75 mg daily with sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. DLT included grade 3 
      transaminitis, diarrhoea and fatigue. Most common treatment-related adverse 
      events at MTD (all grades) were diarrhoea (85%), rash (59%), hypertension (44%), 
      fatigue (30%), anorexia (22%) and hand-foot syndrome (22%). Four patients (15%) 
      had PR and 13 (48%) had SD. PR or SD was observed for ≥6 months in seven 
      patients. The median overall survival was 14.4 months. Selumetinib exposures in 
      combination with sorafenib were comparable to other monotherapy studies. A 
      reduction in permeability-surface area product noted in DCE-MRI with treatment 
      correlated with worse survival outcomes. CONCLUSION: The MTD of selumetinib was 
      75 mg daily when combined with sorafenib 400 mg twice a day in CP ≤7 HCC. 
      Acceptable adverse events and encouraging anti-tumour activity warrant further 
      evaluation. DCE-MRI findings deserve prospective evaluation. CLINICALTRIALSGOV

TI  - HATT: a phase IV, single-arm, open-label study of sorafenib in Taiwanese patients 
      with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 199-208
LID - 10.1007/s12072-016-9774-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib significantly improves survival in patients with advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This phase IV study assessed sorafenib 
      efficacy/safety in Taiwanese patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh A status. 
      METHODS: All patients received 400 mg sorafenib BID. Safety, efficacy, sorafenib 
      pharmacokinetics, and Child-Pugh progression were evaluated. A hand-foot skin 
      reaction (HFSR) prevention substudy assessed HFSR incidence and grade/severity 
      and time to HFSR in 29 and 34 patients randomized to corticosteroid and 
      noncorticosteroid ointments, respectively, and in 88 nonrandomized patients. 
      RESULTS: The 151 patients included 120 (80%) male patients and 81 (54%) with 
      stage IV disease. Mean sorafenib dose was 626 mg/day, and median treatment 
      duration was 4.2 months. Median overall survival (OS), progression-free survival, 
      and time to progression (TTP) were 8.6, 2.7, and 3.8 months, respectively. 
      Disease control and response rates (partial responses only) were 48 and 6.6%, 
      respectively. Median TTP from Child-Pugh A to B/C was 88 days. Drug-related 
      adverse events (AEs) occurred in 89.4% of patients; none were new or unexpected. 
      The most frequent grade ≥3 drug-related, treatment-emergent AEs were HFSR 
      (13.2%), diarrhea (11.9%), and hypertension (6.6%). Corticosteroid ointment 
      tended to reduce the severity and incidence of all HFSR-associated parameters. 
      Pharmacokinetic exposure was unaltered by Child-Pugh progression. The final 
      pharmacokinetic model predicted 13.1 and 33.8% reductions in sorafenib exposure 
      over 6 and 12 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: There was a trend of longer OS 
      and TTP in Taiwanese patients with advanced HCC compared with patients with 
      advanced HCC in the Asia-Pacific trial. Sorafenib exposure did not correlate with 
      liver function. Reduced pharmacokinetic exposure over time was unrelated to 
      reduced or interrupted dosing.

TI  - Impact of Crystal Habit on the Dissolution Rate and In Vivo Pharmacokinetics of 
      Sorafenib Tosylate.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26113469 [doi]
LID - 3469
AB  - The dissolution rate is the rate-limiting step for Biopharmaceutics 
      Classification System (BCS) class II drugs to enhance their in vivo 
      pharmacokinetic behaviors. There are some factors affecting the dissolution rate, 
      such as polymorphism, particle size, and crystal habit. In this study, to improve 
      the dissolution rate and enhance the in vivo pharmacokinetics of sorafenib 
      tosylate (Sor-Tos), a BCS class II drug, two crystal habits of Sor-Tos were 
      prepared. A plate-shaped crystal habit (ST-A) and a needle-shaped crystal habit 
      (ST-B) were harvested by recrystallization from acetone (ACN) and n-butanol 
      (BuOH), respectively. The surface chemistry of the two crystal habits was 
      determined by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data, molecular modeling, and face 
      indexation analysis, and confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) 
      data. The results showed that ST-B had a larger hydrophilic surface than ST-A, 
      and subsequently a higher dissolution rate and a substantial enhancement of the 
      in vivo pharmacokinetic performance of ST-B.

TI  - Impact of P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2) 
      gene dosage on plasma pharmacokinetics and brain accumulation of dasatinib, 
      sorafenib, and sunitinib.
PG  - 486-94
LID - 10.1124/jpet.113.205583 [doi]
AB  - Low brain accumulation of anticancer drugs due to efflux transporters may limit 
      chemotherapeutic efficacy, necessitating a better understanding of the underlying 
      mechanisms. P-glycoprotein (Abcb1a/1b) and breast cancer resistance protein 
      (Abcg2) combination knockout mice often display disproportionately increased 
      brain accumulation of shared drug substrates compared with single transporter 
      knockout mice. Recently developed pharmacokinetic models could explain this 
      phenomenon. To experimentally test these models and their wider relevance for 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitors and other drugs, we selected dasatinib, sorafenib, and 
      sunitinib because of their divergent oral availability and brain accumulation 
      profiles: the brain accumulation of dasatinib is mainly restricted by Abcb1, that 
      of sorafenib mainly by Abcg2, and that of sunitinib equally by Abcb1 and Abcg2. 
      We analyzed the effect of halving the efflux activity of these transporters at 
      the blood-brain barrier by generating heterozygous Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2 knockout mice 
      and testing the plasma and brain levels of the drugs after oral administration at 
      10 mg/kg. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis 
      confirmed the ∼2-fold decreased expression of both transporters in brain. 
      Interestingly, whereas complete knockout of the transporters caused 24- to 
      36-fold increases in brain accumulation of the drugs, the heterozygous mice only 
      displayed 1.6- to 1.9-fold increases of brain accumulation relative to wild-type 
      mice. These results are well in line with the predictions of the pharmacokinetic 
      models and provide strong support for their validity for a wider range of drugs. 
      Moreover, retrospective analysis of fetal accumulation of drugs across the 
      placenta in Abcb1a/1b heterozygous knockout pups suggests that these models 
      equally apply to the maternal-fetal barrier.

TI  - Phase I/II Trial of Sorafenib in Combination with Vinorelbine as First-Line 
      Chemotherapy for Metastatic Breast Cancer.
PG  - e0167906

LID - e0167906
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preclinical models have reported a synergistic interaction between 
      sorafenib and vinorelbine. We investigated the toxicity, efficacy, and 
      pharmacokinetics interaction of this combination as first-line treatment for 
      patients with metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: Patients were HER2-negative and 
      treated with vinorelbine 30 mg/m2 IV days 1,8 every 21 plus daily oral sorafenib. 
      In the phase I portion (3+3 design) patients received sorafenib 200 mg BID 
      (cohort 1) or 400 mg BID (cohort 2). In the phase II expansion, 21 more evaluable 
      patients were planned to receive the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). 
      Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in 6 patients: blood concentrations were 
      compared for each drug in the presence or absence of the other drug. RESULTS: In 
      cohort 1, one patient experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) (grade 3 
      pancreatitis), requiring the expansion of this cohort to 6 patients, without 
      further documented DLTs. In cohort 2, one patient of six experienced a grade 4 
      DLT (asymptomatic rise in amylase not requiring drug discontinuation), 
      establishing this dose level as the MTD (sorafenib 400 mg BID). After expansion 
      at the MTD, a total of 27 patients (median age 57) were treated for a median of 8 
      cycles. One grade 5 febrile neutropenia occurred. With repeated cycles, 52% of 
      patients required at least 1 dose reduction of either drug. One patient 
      experienced a sustained grade 3 fatigue resulting in treatment discontinuation. 
      The response rate was 30%. Median PFS was 5.7 months (95% CI 4.4-7.6), and 
      clinical benefit (absence of disease progression at 6 months) was 48%. PK 
      analysis showed a significant interaction between the two drugs, resulting in a 
      higher Cmax of vinorelbine in the presence of sorafenib. CONCLUSION: The 
      combination of sorafenib and vinorelbine at full doses is feasible but not devoid 
      of toxicity, likely also due to a significant PK interaction. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00764972.

TI  - Effect of CYP3A-inducing anti-epileptics on sorafenib exposure: results of a 
      phase II study of sorafenib plus daily temozolomide in adults with recurrent 
      glioblastoma.
PG  - 57-66
LID - 10.1007/s11060-010-0217-6 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib, an oral VEGFR-2, Raf, PDGFR, c-KIT and Flt-3 inhibitor, is active 
      against renal cell and hepatocellular carcinomas, and has recently demonstrated 
      promising activity for lung and breast cancers. In addition, various protracted 
      temozolomide dosing schedules have been evaluated as a strategy to further 
      enhance its anti-tumor activity. We reasoned that sorafenib and protracted, daily 
      temozolomide may provide complementary therapeutic benefit, and therefore 
      performed a phase 2 trial among recurrent glioblastoma patients. Adult 
      glioblastoma patients at any recurrence after standard temozolomide 
      chemoradiotherapy received sorafenib (400 mg twice daily) and continuous daily 
      temozolomide (50 mg/m²/day). Assessments were performed every eight weeks. The 
      primary endpoint was progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS-6) and secondary 
      end points were radiographic response, overall survival (OS), safety and 
      sorafenib pharmacokinetics. Of 32 enrolled patients, 12 (38%) were on CYP3-A 
      inducing anti-epileptics (EIAEDs), 17 (53%) had 2 or more prior progressions, 15 
      had progressed while receiving 5-day temozolomide, and 12 (38%) had failed either 
      prior bevacizumab or VEGFR inhibitor therapy. The most common grade ≥ 3 
      toxicities were palmer-planter erythrodysesthesia (19%) and elevated 
      amylase/lipase (13%). Sorafenib pharmacokinetic exposures were comparable on day 
      1 regardless of EIAED status, but significantly lower on day 28 for patients on 
      EIAEDs (P = 0.0431). With a median follow-up of 93 weeks, PFS-6 was 9.4%. Only 
      one patient (3%) achieved a partial response. In conclusion, sorafenib can be 
      safely administered with daily temozolomide, but this regimen has limited 
      activity for recurrent GBM. Co-administration of EIAEDs can lower sorafenib 
      exposures in this population.

      evaluating sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to 
      assess differences in safety and efficacy based on Child-Pugh (CP) status (A/B). 
      METHODS: Patients received sorafenib 400 mg PO bid. We analyzed safety, 
      pharmacokinetic (PK), and efficacy data in the two CP groups. RESULTS: 
      Ninety-eight patients were CP A; 38 were CP B, with a median duration of therapy 
      of 4 and 1.8 months, respectively. Grade 3/4 adverse events in the CP A and B 
      groups, respectively, included hyperbilirubinemia (14% and 53%), ascites (3% and 
      5%), and encephalopathy (3% and 13%). Median overall survival (OS) in the CP A 
      group was 9.5 months, compared with 3.2 months in the CP B population. Responses 
      were limited in both groups. AUC and C(max) values were comparable between the 
      two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the lack of randomization against placebo or no 
      therapy in this study, it is unclear if the more frequent worsening of liver 
      cirrhosis and outcome of CP B patients are drug related or due to disease 
      progression, or both. As expected, outcome was poorer in patients with CP B than 
      in those with CP A cirrhosis. The hyperbilirubinemia seen in both groups may be 
      at least partly related to inhibition of UGT1A1 by sorafenib. PK profiles were 
      similar in the two groups. More data are needed to confirm and more fully 
      understand the safety and efficacy of sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC and 
      CP B cirrhosis.

AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib is a multi-kinase inhibitor, which was approved as first-line 
      treatment for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We conducted 
      a phase 1 study of sorafenib plus S-1 in patients with advanced HCC. EXPERIMENTAL 
      DESIGN: We designed to escalate S-1 at 4 different dose levels with fixed dose of 
      sorafenib. Four dose levels were as follows: level 1, D1-14 S-1 50 mg/m(2)/day + 
      D1-21 sorafenib 400 mg bid; level 2, D1-14 S-1 60 mg/m(2)/day + D1-21 sorafenib 
      400 mg bid; level 3,, D1-14 S-1 70 mg/m(2)/day + D1-21 sorafenib 400 mg bid; 
      level 4, D1-14 S-1 80 mg/m(2)/day + D1-21 sorafenib 400 mg bid. The treatment was 
      repeated every 3 weeks. RESULTS: From August 2009 to July 2010, 20 patients with 
      advanced HCC were enrolled. The median age was 48 years (range, 29-74). Eighteen 
      (90%) patients had hepatitis B viral infection and 19 (95%) patients were rated 
      as Child-Pugh class A. The dose-limiting toxicities were grade 4 infection and 
      thrombocytopenia. After a median follow-up duration of 8.6 months (range, 
      3.7-14.2 months), median PFS was 3.9 months (95% CI, 0.8-7.0 months) and median 
      OS was 10.4 months (95% CI, 0-22.4 months). In pharmacokinetic analysis, there 
      was no statistically significant drug interaction between sorafenib and S-1. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The combination of sorafenib and S-1 showed tolerable toxicity 
      profile and modest clinical efficacy in patients with advanced HCC. The 
      recommended dose of sorafenib and S-1 was 400 mg twice daily and 40 mg/m(2) twice 
      daily, respectively.

TI  - Phase IB study of sorafenib in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin in 
      patients with refractory solid tumors.
PG  - 333-9
LID - 10.1007/s00280-011-1685-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006), a multikinase inhibitor, has been shown to 
      inhibit tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis by targeting Raf kinase, vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptor, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor. 
      This study investigated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of 
      sorafenib in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin. METHODS: Patients with 
      advanced solid tumors were treated with 75 mg/m(2) cisplatin on day 1 and 
      1,250 mg/m(2) gemcitabine on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle. On day 5 of cycle 
      1, sorafenib 400 mg twice daily was started and continued throughout the complete 
      treatment cycles without interruption. RESULTS: Nineteen patients were valid for 
      safety analysis. The most frequent toxicities related to the cytotoxic agents 
      were hematological disorders. Sorafenib-related toxicities were skin-related, 
      gastrointestinal, and constitutional symptoms. No clinically relevant 
      pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between sorafenib, cisplatin, and 
      gemcitabine was detected. AUC(0-72) and C (max) of total and unbound platinum 
      were only marginally changed by concomitant sorafenib. Concomitant sorafenib 
      increased mean AUC and C (max) of gemcitabine by 12 and 21%. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Sorafenib as continuous oral treatment in combination with gemcitabine and 
      cisplatin demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. No clinically relevant 
      pharmacokinetic interaction was detected. Preliminary antitumor activity, 
      pharmacokinetic, and safety data support the recommendation of 400 mg sorafenib 
      twice daily in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine to be further evaluated 
      in clinical studies.

AB  - A simple and sensitive UPLC-MS/MS assay was developed and validated for rapid 
      determination of BZG in rat plasma and tissues. All biological samples were 
      prepared by protein precipitation method using Imatinib as an internal standard 
      (IS). The analyte and IS were separated on a C18 reverse phase analytical column 
      with 4.5 min of analytical run, at flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The detection was 
      performed on a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer equipped with 
      electrospray ionization (ESI) by multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) of the 
      transitions at m/z 451.0→254.0 for BZG and m/z 494.3→394.1 for IS, respectively. 
      The linearity of this method was found to be within the concentration range of 
      0.5-2500 ng/mL with a lower limit of quantification of 0.5 ng/mL. All validation 
      parameter results were within the acceptable range described in guideline for 
      bioanalytical method validation. The method was successfully applied to a 
      pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution study of BZG in rats. With the 
      preliminary knowledge of in vivo pharmacokinetics and disposition properties, 
      this study will be beneficial for further development of BZG.

AB  - Sorafenib (SFN), a hydrophobic anticancer drug, has several limitations 
      predominantly poor aqueous solubility and hepatic first-pass effect, limiting its 
      oral delivery that results into several other complications. Present study aims 
      to develop Sorafenib loaded polymersomes using poly butadiene block poly ethylene 
      oxide (PB-b-PEO), an amphiphilic co-block polymer. Prior to drug loading, 
      critical aggregate concentration (CAC) of polymer was calculated for stable 
      formulation synthesis. The developed SFN loaded PB-b-PEO polymersomes 
      (SFN-PB-b-PEO, test formulation) characterized by DLS and cryo-TEM showed 
      particle size 282 nm, polydispersity (PDI) of less than 0.29 and membrane 
      thickness of about 20 nm. SFN-PB-b-PEO polymersomes demonstrated encapsulation 
      efficiency of 71% and showed sustained drug release up to 144 h. Formulation 
      remained stable for 3 months in suspension form. In vitro cytotoxicity against 
      HepG2 cells showed 1.7 folds improved toxicity compared to SFN suspension. In 
      addition, oral administration of SFN-PB-b-PEO polymersomes in BALB/c mice showed 
      increased C(max) and AUC(0-96) by 1.7 and 2.77-fold respectively (p < 0.05) 
      compared to those of SFN suspension (reference formulation). Findings suggest 
      that the SFN-PB-b-PEO polymersomes can be a potential candidate for oral delivery 
      of SFN.

TI  - Phase I trial of sorafenib in combination with interferon-alpha in Japanese 
      patients with unresectable or metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the safety, pharmacokinetics, tumor response, and 
      immunological parameters of sorafenib plus interferon α-2b [corrected] (IFN) in 
      Japanese patients with advanced RCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: After 2 weeks of 
      IFN-alone treatment, eligible patients received 28-day cycles of continuous 
      sorafenib 200 mg (Cohort 1) or 400 mg (Cohorts 2 and 3) twice daily combined with 
      intramuscular IFN 6 (Cohorts 1 and 2) or 9 (Cohort 3) million international units 
      (MIU) three times a week. RESULTS: A total of 18 patients received at least one 
      dose of sorafenib plus IFN. Five patients had dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). 
      The most common DLT was fatigue, experienced in four DLT patients. All 18 
      patients experienced at least one treatment-emergent adverse event (AE). The most 
      common treatment-emergent AEs included fatigue, fever, platelets, leukocytes, 
      hemoglobin, weight loss and anorexia. Five patients had confirmed partial 
      response and 11 had stable disease, a response rate of 27.8%. IFN had no relevant 
      impact on the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib administered 
      in combination with IFN was well tolerated, with promising results in efficacy. 
      Continuous sorafenib 400 mg twice daily in combination with IFN 6 MIU three times 
      a week is recommended in Japanese patients with advanced RCC.

AB  - To evaluate the effect and mechanism of radiotherapy (RT)-sorafenib 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) in different regimens with conventional or high dose 
      irradiation. Between February 2012 and December 2018, 43 patients with portal 
      vein tumor thrombosis treated with sorafenib plus conventional RT (58%) or 
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT, 42%) were retrospectively reviewed. In 
      vivo and in vitro studies of concurrent and sequential RT with sorafenib were 
      designed. SBRT resulted in a 3-fold increase in complete recanalization compared 
      to conventional RT group (28% vs. 8%, p = 0.014). Compared to the control group, 
      the area under the concentration vs. time curve (AUC) of sorafenib was increased 
      in the concurrent RT(2Gy) and RT(9Gy) groups and the sequential RT(9Gy) group by 
      132% (p = 0.046), 163% (p = 0.038) and 102% (p = 0.018), respectively; and was 
      decreased by 59% in the sequential RT(2Gy) group (p = 0.036). Sequential RT(2Gy) 
      and RT(9Gy) increased CYP3A4 activity by 82% (p = 0.028) and 203% (p = 0.0004), 
      respectively, compared to that with the corresponding concurrent regimen. SBRT 
      produced better recanalization than conventional RT with sorafenib. The AUC of 
      sorafenib was modulated by RT. P-gp expression was not influenced by RT. The 
      sequential RT regimen increased CYP3A4 activity that may increase the 
      RT-sorafenib synergy effect and overall sorafenib activity. The biodistribution 
      of sorafenib was modulated by local RT with the different regimens.

TI  - Phase I study of sorafenib in combination with docetaxel and prednisone in 
      chemo-naïve patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.
PG  - 293-303

AB  - PURPOSE: We performed a dose-escalation study to investigate the safety of 
      sorafenib in combination with docetaxel and prednisone in chemo-naïve patients 
      with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). METHODS: Six 
      patients were included per dose level. Following docetaxel infusion on day 1 
      (75 mg/m(2)/q3 weeks), sorafenib was administered at 200 mg BID on days 2-19 
      (dose level 1), at 200 mg BID on days 1-21 (dose level 2), at 400 mg BID on days 
      2-19 (dose level 3), at 400 mg BID on days 1-21 (dose level 4). Maximal tolerated 
      dose (MTD) was exceeded if ≥2 patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) 
      during cycle 1. The recommended phase 2 dose for sorafenib was defined as one 
      dose level below MTD. If MTD was not reached, the highest feasible dose would be 
      selected to treat an expanded cohort to confirm safety. RESULTS: Two DLTs were 
      observed during sorafenib dose-escalation consisting of grade 4 febrile 
      neutropenia (dose level 2) and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome (HFS) (dose level 3). 
      Our pharmacokinetic results showed an increased exposure to docetaxel across all 
      dose levels during sorafenib comedication. The main grade ≥3 toxicities were 
      neutropenia (35 %), HFS (27 %), and febrile neutropenia (19 %). The 
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate was 74 %. Median overall survival 
      was 25.2 months. CONCLUSION: Three-weekly docetaxel and prednisone could be 
      combined with sorafenib at 400 mg BID on days 1-21 without reaching MTD. However, 
      we observed a pharmacokinetic interaction between sorafenib and docetaxel, 
      associated with significant toxicities, raising concerns about the safety of this 
      combination in mCRPC.

AB  - CEP-32496, also known as RXDX-105 or Agerafenib, is a new orally active inhibitor 
      for the mutated v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF(V600E)), 
      which has attracted considerable attention in clinical trials for the treatment 
      of human cancers. Here, we used carbon-11-labeled CEP-32496 ([(11)C]CEP-32496) as 
      a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer to evaluate its pharmacokinetic 
      properties and explore its potential for in vivo imaging. Following radiotracer 
      synthesis, we performed in vitro binding assays and autoradiography of 
      [(11)C]CEP-32496 in the A375 melanoma cell line and on tumor tissue sections from 
      mice harboring the BRAF(V600E) mutation. These were followed by PET scans and 
      biodistribution studies on nude mice bearing subcutaneous A375 cell-induced 
      melanoma. [(11)C]CEP-32496 showed high binding affinity for BRAF(V600E)-positive 
      A375 melanoma cells and densely accumulated in the respective tissue sections; 
      this could be blocked by the BRAF(V600E) selective antagonist sorafenib and by 
      unlabeled CEP-32496. The PET and biodistribution results revealed that 
      [(11)C]CEP-32496 accumulated continuously but slowly into the tumor within a 
      period of 0 to 60 minutes postinjection in A375-melanoma-bearing nude mice. 
      Metabolite analysis showed high in vivo stability of [(11)C]CEP-32496 in plasma. 
      Our results indicate that [(11)C]CEP-32496 has excellent specificity and affinity 
      for the BRAF(V600E) mutation in vitro, while its noninvasive personalized 
      diagnostic role needs to be studied further.

TI  - Discovery of a Nanomolar Multikinase Inhibitor (KST016366): A New Benzothiazole 
      Derivative with Remarkable Broad-Spectrum Antiproliferative Activity.

AB  - Herein we report the discovery of compound 6 [KST016366; 
      4-((2-(3-(4-((4-ethylpiperazin-1-yl)methyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)ureido)benzo[d]thiazol-6-yl)oxy)picolinamide] 
      as a new potent multikinase inhibitor through minor structural modification of 
      our previously reported RAF kinase inhibitor A. In vitro anticancer evaluation of 
      6 showed substantial broad-spectrum antiproliferative activity against 60 human 
      cancer cell lines. In particular, it showed GI50 values of 51.4 and 19 nm against 
      leukemia K-562 and colon carcinoma KM12 cell lines, respectively. Kinase 
      screening of compound 6 revealed its nanomolar-level inhibitory activity of 
      certain oncogenic kinases implicated in both tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. 
      Interestingly, 6 displays IC50 values of 0.82, 3.81, and 53 nm toward Tie2, TrkA, 
      and ABL-1 (wild-type and T315I mutant) kinases, respectively. Moreover, 6 is 
      orally bioavailable with a favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic profile. Compound 6 
      may serve as a promising candidate for further development of potent anticancer 
      chemotherapeutics.

TI  - Combination of letrozole, metronomic cyclophosphamide and sorafenib is 
      well-tolerated and shows activity in patients with primary breast cancer.
PG  - 52-60
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2014.563 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess whether the combination of letrozole, metronomic 
      cyclophosphamide and sorafenib (LCS) is well tolerated and shows activity in 
      primary breast cancer (BC). METHODS: Thirteen oestrogen receptor-positive, 
      postmenopausal, T2-4, N0-1 BC patients received the LCS combination for 6 months. 
      In these patients we examined the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib and 
      cyclophosphamide, toxicity of the regimen, the clinical response to therapy and 
      changes in the levels of biologically relevant biomarkers. RESULTS: Adequate 
      plasma concentrations of sorafenib were achieved in patients when it was dosed in 
      combination with L+C. The mean plasma concentrations of C were consistently lower 
      following administration of LCS, compared with administration of L+C only. The 
      most common drug-related grade 3/4 adverse events were skin rash (69.3%), 
      hand-foot skin reaction (69.3%) and diarrhoea (46.1%). According to RECIST 
      Criteria, a clinical complete response was observed in 6 of 13 patients. A 
      significant reduction in tumour size, evaluated with MRI, was also observed 
      between baseline and 14 days of treatment in all 13 patients (P=0.005). A 
      significant reduction in SUV uptake, measured by (18)FDG-PET/CT, was observed in 
      all patients between baseline and 30 days of treatment (P=0.015) and between 
      baseline and definitive surgery (P=0.0002). Using modified CT Criteria, a 
      response was demonstrated in 8 out of 10 evaluable patients at 30 days and in 11 
      out of 13 evaluable patients at the definitive surgery. A significant reduction 
      in Ki67 expression was observed in all patients at day 14 compared with baseline 
      (P<0.00001) and in 9 out of 13 patients at the definitive surgery compared with 
      baseline (P<0.03). There was also a significant suppression of CD31 and VEGF-A 
      expression in response to treatment (P=0.01 and P=0.007, respectively). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The LCS combination is feasible and tolerable. The tumour response 
      and target biomarker modulation indicate that the combination is clinically and 
      biologically active.

AB  - Sorafenib (SOF; an angiogenesis inhibitor) and 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA; a 
      contrast agent for computed tomography imaging)-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic 
      acid) (PLGA) microspheres (MSs) were fabricated. Embolization, drug delivery, and 
      tracing the distribution of MSs for liver cancer therapy were accomplished with 
      the developed MSs after their intra-arterial (IA) administration. SOF/TIBA/PLGA 
      MSs with 24.8-28.5 µm mean diameters were prepared, and the sustained release of 
      SOF from MSs was observed. Lower systemic exposure (represented as the area under 
      the curve [AUC]) and maximum drug concentration in plasma (C(max)) values of the 
      SOF/TIBA/PLGA MSs group (IA administration, 1 mg/kg) in the results of the 
      pharmacokinetic study imply alleviated unwanted systemic effects (e.g., hand and 
      foot syndrome), compared to the SOF solution group (oral administration, 
      10 mg/kg). In a rat hepatoma model, the increase of microvessel density (MVD) 
      following arterial embolization (i.e., reactive angiogenesis) was partially 
      limited by SOF/TIBA/PLGA MSs. This resulted in the SOF/TIBA/PLGA MSs group (IA 
      administration, single dosing, 1 mg/kg) showing a smaller tumor size increase and 
      viable tumor portion compared to the TIBA/PLGA MSs group. These findings suggest 
      that a developed SOF/TIBA/PLGA MS can be a promising therapeutic system for liver 
      cancer using a transarterial embolization strategy.

TI  - Pharmacokinetically guided dosing of oral sorafenib in pediatric hepatocellular 
      carcinoma: A simulation study.
PG  - 2152-2160
LID - 10.1111/cts.13069 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib improves outcomes in adult hepatocellular carcinoma; however, hand foot 
      skin reaction (HFSR) is a dose limiting toxicity of sorafenib that limits its 
      use. HFSR has been associated with sorafenib systemic exposure. The objective of 
      this study was to use modeling and simulation to determine whether using 
      pharmacokinetically guided dosing to achieve a predefined sorafenib target range 
      could reduce the rate of HFSR. Sorafenib steady-state exposures (area under the 
      concentration curve from 0 to 12-h [AUC(0->12 h) ]) were simulated using 
      published sorafenib pharmacokinetics at either a fixed dosage (90 mg/m(2) /dose) 
      or a pharmacokinetically guided dose targeting an AUC(0->12 h) between 20 and 
      55 h µg/ml. Dosages were either rounded to the nearest quarter of a tablet 
      (50 mg) or capsule (10 mg). A Cox proportional hazard model from a previously 
      published study was used to quantify HFSR toxicity. Simulations showed that 
      in-target studies increased from 50% using fixed doses with tablets to 74% using 
      pharmacokinetically guided dosing with capsules. The power to observe at least 4 
      of 6 patients in the target range increased from 33% using fixed dosing with 
      tablets to 80% using pharmacokinetically guided with capsules. The expected HFSR 
      toxicity rate decreased from 22% using fixed doses with tablets to 16% using 
      pharmacokinetically guided dosing with capsules. The power to observe less than 6 
      of 24 studies with HFSR toxicity increased from 51% using fixed dosing with 
      tablets to 88% using pharmacokinetically guided with capsules. Our simulations 
      provide the rationale to use pharmacokinetically guided sorafenib dosing to 
      maintain effective exposures that potentially improve tolerability in pediatric 
      clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and 
      antitumor activity. In most cases, the commercially available 200 mg tablet is 
      not suitable for administration to children. We studied the chemical and physical 
      stability of extemporaneously prepared formulations and evaluated the 
      pharmacokinetic profile of cut tablets and smaller-dosage capsules of sorafenib 
      in children. PROCEDURE: Commercially available 200 mg tablets of sorafenib 
      tosylate were used to prepare liquid suspensions of sorafenib in oil and 
      Ora-Plus(®):Ora-Sweet(®) solution, and to prepare 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 mg 
      capsules. Plasma concentrations of sorafenib were measured in patients receiving 
      capsules and cut tablets, using a validated HPLC-based method with tandem mass 
      spectrometric detection. RESULTS: At room temperature and under refrigeration, 
      sorafenib concentrations in Ora Plus(®):Ora Sweet(®) were highly variable (means 
      ranging from 75% to 131% of the intended concentration of 50 mg/ml). In oil 
      suspension, sorafenib concentrations were inconsistent during compounding. In 
      contrast, all smaller-dosage capsules, except the 5 mg capsule, were within 
      91-99% of the intended content and were stable at room temperature for at least 8 
      months. Sorafenib pharmacokinetic parameters in patients receiving capsules or 
      cut tablets were consistent with those reported previously in adults and children 
      receiving intact tablets. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib is not stable in an oral 
      suspension prepared from commercially available tablets, but compounded capsules 
      in smaller-dosage forms that can be sprinkled on food or cut tablets are 
      alternatives for administration to children who need smaller doses based on body 
      surface area or cannot swallow tablets.

TI  - Preparation and evaluation of long circulating erythrocyte membrane-cloaked 
      anti-cancer drug delivery system.
PG  - 1278-1287
LID - 10.1007/s13346-020-00780-x [doi]
AB  - Recently, biomimetic hybrid drug delivery systems, especially erythrocyte 
      membrane-based drug delivery systems, have been utilized to achieve high 
      bioavailability, and biocompatibility, in the meantime, to reduce immunogenicity 
      and effectively evade phagocytosis of the host immune system. Here, we developed 
      a novel drug delivery system of red blood cell membrane-derived vesicles (RDVs) 
      cloaked poly (acrylic acid)-cystamine hydrochloride-D-α-tocopherol succinate 
      (PAAssVES) nanoparticles. The PAAssVES nanoparticles were prepared via 
      emulsification and solvent volatilization method, followed by loading of the 
      model anti-cancer drug, sorafenib (SFN). Then RDVs and SFN-PAAssVES nanoparticles 
      were uniformly mixed and co-extruded through polycarbonate membrane. The prepared 
      RDV-coated nanoparticles (RDV-NPs) had good stability, with a zeta potential of 
      - 10.7 mV and particle size of 113.5 nm. MTT assay was used to analyze the 
      effects of RDV-NPs on cell viability in two kinds of gastric cancer cell lines 
      BGC-823 and MKN-45. The results showed that RDV-NPs significantly decreased cell 
      viability. In vitro drug release investigation showed that RDV-NPs had good 
      sustained release properties and the cumulative release was 71.5% in 72 h. In 
      pharmacokinetic studies, SD male rats' intravenous injection with RDV-NP solution 
      showed a more smooth plasma concentration-time profile. Compared with free SFN 
      treatment and SFN-PAAssVES group, RDV-NPs enhanced the AUC by about 4.1-fold and 
      2.0-fold. The MRT and t(1/2) of RDV-NPs were increased to 23.670 ± 2.347 h and 
      24.450 ± 2.652 h. Our study demonstrated the promise of using RDV-NPs as a long 
      circulating anti-cancer drug delivery system. Graphical abstract.

TI  - Axitinib plasma pharmacokinetics and ethnic differences.
PG  - 521-32
LID - 10.1007/s10637-015-0214-x [doi]
AB  - Axitinib, a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor of vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3, showed improved progression-free 
      survival over sorafenib in patients previously treated for advanced renal cell 
      carcinoma in the AXIS trial. Although a few studies had established the efficacy 
      and safety of axitinib in Asian patients, additional evaluation was necessary to 
      obtain regulatory approval in several Asian countries, especially in light of 
      ethnic differences that are known to exist in genetic polymorphisms for 
      metabolizing enzymes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A5, CYP2C19 and uridine 
      diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1, which are involved in axitinib 
      metabolism. Axitinib plasma pharmacokinetics following single or multiple 
      administration of oral axitinib in Asian (Japanese or Chinese) healthy subjects 
      as well as Asian patients with advanced solid tumors was compared with that 
      obtained in Caucasians. Upon review, the data demonstrated that axitinib can be 
      characterized as not sensitive to ethnic factors based on its pharmacokinetic and 
      pharmacodynamic properties. Axitinib exhibited similar pharmacokinetics in Asian 
      and non-Asian subjects. A pooled population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated 
      lack of a clinically meaningful effect of ethnicity on axitinib disposition. 
      Therefore, dose adjustment for axitinib on the basis of ethnicity is not 
      currently warranted.

TI  - Novel hinge binder improves activity and pharmacokinetic properties of BRAF 
      inhibitors.
PG  - 5639-55
LID - 10.1021/jm100383b [doi]
AB  - Mutated BRAF serine/threonine kinase is implicated in several types of cancer, 
      with particularly high frequency in melanoma and colorectal carcinoma. We 
      recently reported on the development of BRAF inhibitors based on a tripartite 
      A-B-C system featuring an imidazo[4,5]pyridin-2-one group hinge binder. Here we 
      present the design, synthesis, and optimization of a new series of inhibitors 
      with a different A-B-C system that has been modified by the introduction of a 
      range of novel hinge binders (A ring). The optimization of the hinge binding 
      moiety has enabled the development of compounds with low nanomolar potencies in 
      both BRAF inhibition and cellular assays. These compounds display optimal 
      pharmacokinetic properties that warrant further in vivo investigations.

TI  - Results from an in vitro and a clinical/pharmacological phase I study with the 
      combination irinotecan and sorafenib.
PG  - 55-63
AB  - PURPOSE: This single-centre, open-label, phase I dose-escalation study was 
      performed to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of 
      sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, combined with irinotecan, a cytotoxic agent, 
      in patients with advanced, refractory solid tumours. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In an 
      initial dose-escalation phase, patients received irinotecan 125 mg/m(2) and 
      sorafenib 100, 200 and 400 mg twice daily (bid) (cohorts 1-3). In an extended 
      phase, colorectal cancer (CRC) patients received fixed-dose irinotecan 140 mg and 
      sorafenib 400 mg bid (cohort 4). RESULTS: Thirty-four patients were treated: 20 
      in the dose-escalation phase (common tumour types: CRC [45%], ovarian [5%], 
      pancreatic [5%]) and 14 patients in the CRC extension. Frequent drug-related 
      adverse events were gastrointestinal symptoms, dermatological reactions and 
      constitutional symptoms. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Generally, 
      concomitant administration of irinotecan had no impact on the PK of sorafenib. 
      Sorafenib 100 or 200 mg bid had no impact on the PK of irinotecan or its 
      metabolite SN38. In contrast, sorafenib 400 mg bid significantly increased 
      irinotecan and SN38 exposures; however, this was not associated with increased 
      toxicities. Stable disease was achieved in 12/20 (60%) evaluable patients in 
      cohorts 1-3, and 10/13 (77%) evaluable patients in cohort 4. A further patient 
      from cohort 4 had a partial response of >200 days. The increase of SN38 exposure 
      might be due to inhibition of formation of the SN38 glucuronide by sorafenib. In 
      vitro, sorafenib strongly inhibited SN38 glucuronidation in human liver 
      microsomes as indicated by a K(i) value of 2.7 micromol/l. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib 
      400 mg bid can be combined with irinotecan 125 mg/m(2) or 140 mg for the 
      treatment of patients with advanced, refractory solid tumours, although 
      monitoring for toxicity is recommended.

TI  - Phase II study of sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 4293-300
AB  - PURPOSE: This phase II study of sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor that 
      targets Raf kinase and receptor tyrosine kinases, assessed efficacy, toxicity, 
      pharmacokinetics, and biomarkers in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
      patients. METHODS: Patients with inoperable HCC, no prior systemic treatment, and 
      Child-Pugh (CP) A or B, received continuous, oral sorafenib 400 mg bid in 4-week 
      cycles. Tumor response was assessed every two cycles using modified WHO criteria. 
      Sorafenib pharmacokinetics were measured in plasma samples. Biomarker analysis 
      included phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase (pERK) in 
      pretreatment biopsies (immunohistochemistry) and blood-cell RNA expression 
      patterns in selected patients. RESULTS: Of 137 patients treated (male, 71%; 
      median age, 69 years), 72% had CP A, and 28% had CP B. On the basis of 
      independent assessment, three (2.2%) patients achieved a partial response, eight 
      (5.8%) had a minor response, and 46 (33.6%) had stable disease for at least 16 
      weeks. Investigator-assessed median time to progression (TTP) was 4.2 months, and 
      median overall survival was 9.2 months. Grade 3/4 drug-related toxicities 
      included fatigue (9.5%), diarrhea (8.0%), and hand-foot skin reaction (5.1%). 
      There were no significant pharmacokinetic differences between CP A and B 
      patients. Pretreatment tumor pERK levels correlated with TTP. A panel of 18 
      expressed genes was identified that distinguished "nonprogressors" from 
      "progressors" with an estimated 100% accuracy. CONCLUSION: Although single-agent 
      sorafenib has modest efficacy in HCC, the manageable toxicity and mechanisms of 
      action support a role for combination regimens with other anticancer agents.

TI  - In vivo assessment of the drug interaction between sorafenib and paracetamol in 
      rats.
PG  - 1039-1048
LID - 10.1007/s00280-020-04075-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) used for 
      the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma and 
      radioactive iodine resistant thyroid carcinoma. Neoplastic diseases are the cause 
      of pain, which may occur regardless of the stage of the disease. Paracetamol is a 
      non-opioid analgesic used alone or in combination with opioids for the treatment 
      of cancer pain. Numerous studies have pointed out changes in the pharmacokinetic 
      parameters of TKIs when co-administered with paracetamol. The aim of the study 
      was to assess drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between sorafenib and paracetamol. 
      METHODS: Rats were divided into three groups, each consisting of eight animals. 
      The first group received sorafenib (II(S)), the second group received 
      sorafenib + paracetamol (I(S+PA)), whereas the third group received only 
      paracetamol (III(PA)). A single dose of sorafenib (100 mg/kg b.w.) and 
      paracetamol (100 mg/kg b.w.) was administered orally. The plasma concentrations 
      of sorafenib and its metabolite-N-oxide as well as paracetamol and its 
      glucuronide and sulphate metabolites were measured using validated 
      high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with ultraviolet detection. 
      RESULTS: The co-administration of sorafenib and paracetamol increased the maximum 
      concentration (C(max)) of paracetamol by 33% (p = 0.0372). In the I(S+ PA) group 
      the C(max) of paracetamol glucuronide was reduced by 48% (p =  < 0.0001), whereas 
      the C(max) of paracetamol sulphate was higher by 153% (p = 0.0012) than in the 
      III(PA) group. Paracetamol increased sorafenib and sorafenib N-oxide C(max) by 
      60% (p = 0.0068) and 83% (p = 0.0023), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A greater 
      knowledge of DDI between sorafenib and paracetamol may help adjust dose properly 
      and avoid toxicity effects in individual patients.

AB  - Sorafenib, a potent anticancer drug, has low absorption in the gastrointestinal 
      tract due to its poor aqueous solubility. The main purpose of this investigation 
      was to design sorafenib nanoparticle using a newly developed technique, 
      nanoparticulation using fat and supercritical fluid (NUFS™) to improve the 
      absorption of sorafenib. The quality by design (QbD) tool was adopted to define 
      the optimal formulation variables: hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), 
      polyvinyl pyrrolidone K30 (PVP), and poloxamer. The studied response variables 
      were particle size of nanoparticle, dissolution (5, 60, and 180 min), drug 
      concentration time profile of nanoparticle formulations, and maximum drug 
      concentration. The result of particle size revealed that an increase in 
      concentration of poloxamer and HPMC decreased the particle size of nanoparticles 
      (p < 0.05). Likewise, the concentration of drug release at different time point 
      (5, 60, and 180 min) showed HPMC and poloxamer had positive effects on drug 
      dissolution while PVP had negative effects on it. The design space was built in 
      accordance with the particle size of nanoparticle (target < 500 nm) and 
      dissolution of sorafenib (target > 7 µm/mL), following failure probability 
      analysis using Monte Carlo simulations. In vivo pharmacokinetics studies in 
      beagle dogs demonstrated that optimized formulation of sorafenib (F3 and F4 
      tablets) exhibited higher blood drug profiles indicating better absorption 
      compared to the reference tablet (Nexavar(®)). In conclusion, this study showed 
      the importance of systematic formulation design for understanding the effect of 
      formulation variables on the characteristics of nanoparticles of the poorly 
      soluble drug.

TI  - A phase I dose-escalation study to evaluate safety and tolerability of sorafenib 
      combined with sirolimus in patients with advanced solid cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination of sorafenib (vascular endothelial growth factor 
      receptor 2 inhibitor) and sirolimus (mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor) 
      might work synergistically. METHODS: A phase I dose-escalation study with 
      sorafenib twice a day (b.i.d.) and sirolimus once daily (q.d.) was performed to 
      determine the recommended dose of the combination in patients with solid tumours. 
      Secondary objectives were to determine the safety profile and maximum tolerated 
      dose (MTD), and to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the combination. 
      RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicities were transaminitis and cutaneous toxicity. The 
      most frequently reported adverse events were elevated transaminases, 
      hypophosphatemia, fatigue, anorexia, diarrhoea, nausea, rash and palmar-plantar 
      erythrodysaesthesia. Sirolimus did not change the PK of sorafenib; in contrast, 
      sorafenib reduced the AUC(0-96) and C(max) of sirolimus. No objective responses 
      were observed; eight patients showed stable disease for a median of 16.3 weeks 
      (range 8-24). The MTD of the combination was sorafenib 200  mg b.i.d. with 
      sirolimus 1 mg q.d. CONCLUSION: The combination of sorafenib and sirolimus showed 
      enhanced toxicity, which could not be explained by the PK of both drugs. The 
      relative low doses at the MTD, in combination with the PK results, do not warrant 
      further development of this combination.

TI  - Phase 1 and pharmacological trial of OPB-31121, a signal transducer and activator

PG  - 1283-91

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and antitumor activity of 
      OPB-31121, a signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 inhibitor, in 
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: HCC patients of 
      Child-Pugh A or B who progressed on, or were intolerant to, sorafenib were 
      eligible for this phase 1 trial. We used a standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation design 
      with a 28-day cycle at dose levels of 50, 100, 200 and 400 mg/day. Tumor 
      responses were assessed using the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid 
      Tumors. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled, of whom 23 received 
      OPB-31121 (20 males; median age, 65 years). The most common adverse drug 
      reactions were nausea (87.0%), vomiting (82.6%), diarrhea (69.6%), 
      fatigue/malaise (52.2%), anorexia (47.8%) and peripheral sensory neuropathy 
      (26.1%). The recommended dose for OPB-31121 was determined to be 200 mg. Six 
      patients had stable disease for 8 weeks or more, resulting in disease control 
      rates of 25.0-42.9%. In the 200-mg dose cohort, three of seven patients had 
      stable disease and a median time to progression of 61.0 days. The maximum 
      concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of OPB-31121 
      were dose proportional. CONCLUSION: OPB-31121 demonstrated insufficient antitumor 
      activity for HCC. Furthermore, peripheral nervous system-related toxicities may 
      negatively affect long-term administration of OPB-31121. Therefore, it was deemed 
      difficult to continue the clinical development of OPB-31121 for treating advanced 
      HCC and further investigation is expected in the agent with favorable profile in 
      this category.

TI  - CF102 for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma: a phase I/II, open-label, 
      dose-escalation study.
PG  - 25-6
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2012-0211 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The A(3) adenosine receptor (A(3)AR) is overexpressed in the tumor 
      and in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). The orally active drug candidate CF102, an A(3)AR agonist, 
      induces apoptosis of HCC cells via deregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway. In 
      this open label phase I/II trial, the safety and clinical effects of CF102 were 
      assessed in patients with advanced unresectable HCC. METHODS: The primary 
      objectives of this trial were to examine the safety and pharmacokinetic (PK) 
      behavior of CF102 given orally (1, 5, and 25 mg BID) in 28-day cycles. Evaluation 
      of anti-tumor effects and the utilization of A(3)AR as a biological predictive 
      marker of response to CF102 were the secondary objectives. RESULTS: Eighteen 
      patients received CF102-six at each dose level. No serious drug-related adverse 
      events or dose-limiting toxicities were observed. CF102 demonstrated good oral 
      bioavailability and linear PK behavior. Median overall survival in the study 
      population, 67% of whom had received prior sorafenib, was 7.8 months, and for 
      Child Pugh B patients (28%) it was 8.1 months. Stable disease by RECIST was 
      observed in four patients for at least 4 months. CF102 maintained liver function 
      over a 6-month period. A correlation between receptor overexpression levels at 
      baseline and patients' overall survival was found. One of the patients who 
      presented with skin nodules that were biopsy-proven to be HCC metastases prior to 
      the trial showed complete metastasis regression during three months of treatment 
      with CF102. CONCLUSIONS: CF102 is safe and well-tolerated, showing favorable PK 
      characteristics in Child Pugh A and B HCC patients, justifying further clinical 
      development.

TI  - Phase 1 trial of tivantinib in combination with sorafenib in adult patients with 
      advanced solid tumors.
PG  - 159-68
LID - 10.1007/s10637-014-0167-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This phase I study evaluated the safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated 
      dose (MTD), and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of tivantinib combined with 
      sorafenib in patients with advanced solid tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 
      standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design was used. At the RP2D, expansion cohorts in 
      5 tumor types could be enrolled. Pharmacogenetic and pharmacodynamic analysis 
      were performed. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients received the study treatment. The 
      combination had no unexpected toxicities. The most common treatment-related 
      adverse events (AE) were rash (40 %), diarrhea (38 %), and anorexia (33 %). The 
      RP2D was tivantinib 360 mg BID and sorafenib 400 mg BID for all cancer 
      histologies, except in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients tivantinib was 240 
      mg BID plus sorafenib 400 mg BID. The overall response rate was 12 % in all 
      patients, 26 % in melanoma, 15 % in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), 10 % in HCC, and 
      0 % in other patients. Disease control rate (CR, PR and SD ≥8 weeks) was 58 % in 
      all patients, 90 % in RCC, 65 % in HCC, 63 % in melanoma, 40 % in breast cancer, 
      and 8 % in NSCLC patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combination treatment could be 
      administered at full standard single-agent doses in all patients except those 
      with HCC, where tivantinib was lowered to 240 mg BID. Preliminary evidence of 
      anticancer activity was observed in patients with RCC, HCC, and melanoma, 
      including patients refractory to sorafenib and/or other anti-VEGF pathway 
      therapies. The combination treatment has therapeutic potential in treating a 
      variety of solid tumors.

TI  - Sorafenib for Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Child-Pugh B Liver 
      Cirrhosis: Lessons Learned from a Terminated Study.
PG  - e1274-e1279
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0718 [doi]
AB  - LESSONS LEARNED: Recruitment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma 
      and Child-Pugh B for sorafenib treatment and additional pharmacokinetic studies 
      is challenging. Patients with Child-Pugh B liver cirrhosis have high rates of 
      cirrhosis-related adverse events. BACKGROUND: Few data are available on the 
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) and Child-Pugh B liver cirrhosis. This study aimed to explore the 
      sorafenib PK and its relationship with efficacy and toxicity in these patients. 
      METHODS: Patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh B7-8 liver function were 
      prospectively recruited at a tertiary center. Adverse events (AEs), 
      progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were recorded. 
      Patients received a starting dose of 200 b.i.d. with toxicity-adjusted dose 
      escalation to a target dose of 400 mg b.i.d. with PK sampling at fixed time 
      points. RESULTS: Between May 2014 and March 2017, 12 patients were screened, of 
      whom 7 progressed to a terminal stage during the screening (n = 6) or shortly 
      after recruitment (n = 1). The five included patients had median PFS of 3.8 
      months (range, 1.7-10.8) and OS of 7.4 months (range, 1.7-25.8). Three patients 
      had severe AEs and one patient had a partial response with an OS of 25.8 months. 
      In 2017, the trial was aborted for lack of accrual. CONCLUSION: Because of low 
      accrual, no conclusion can be drawn on the sorafenib PK in patients with advanced 
      HCC and Child-Pugh B liver cirrhosis. The poor survival and frequent 
      cirrhosis-related AEs suggest limited benefit for most of these patients.

AB  - A simple, economical, fast, and sensitive RP-HPLC-UV method has been developed 
      for the simultaneous quantification of Sorafenib and paclitaxel in biological 
      samples and formulations using piroxicam as an internal standard. The 
      experimental conditions were optimized and method was validated according to the 
      standard guidelines. The separation of both the analytes and internal standard 
      was achieved on Discovery HS C18 column (250mm×4.6mm, 5μm) using Acetonitrile and 
      TFA (0.025%) in the ratio of (65:35V/V) as the mobile phase in isocratic mode at 
      a flow rate of 1ml/min, with a wavelength of 245nm and at a column oven 
      temperature of 25°Cin a short run time of 12min. The limits of detection (LLOD) 
      were 5 and 10ng/ml while the limits of quantification (LLOQ) were 10 and 15ng/ml 
      for sorafenib and paclitaxel, respectively. Sorafenib, paclitaxel and piroxicam 
      (IS) were extracted from biological samples by applying acetonitrile as a 
      precipitating and extraction solvent. The method is linear in the range of 
      15-20,000ng/ml for paclitaxel and 10-5000ng/ml for sorafenib, respectively. The 
      method is sensitive and reliable by considering both of its intra-day and 
      inter-day co-efficient of variance. The method was successfully applied for the 
      quantification of the above mentioned drugs in plasma. The developed method will 
      be applied towards sorafenib and paclitaxel pharmacokinetics studies in animal 
      models.

TI  - Phase I trial of sorafenib and gemcitabine in advanced solid tumors with an 
      expanded cohort in advanced pancreatic cancer.
PG  - 144-51
AB  - BACKGROUND: With its potent inhibitory effects against Raf-1 kinase and vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptor-2, sorafenib is a novel oral anticancer agent 
      targeting signal transduction and angiogenic pathways. This study is designed to 
      combine sorafenib and gemcitabine due to their compatibility in preclinical 
      models and nonoverlapping clinical toxicities. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: An initial 
      dose-escalation part of the study enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors, 
      followed by an expanded cohort at the recommended dose for patients with advanced 
      unresectable or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Sorafenib is administered 
      continuously, whereas gemcitabine is given at 1,000 mg/m2 weekly x 7 followed by 
      1 rest week, then weekly x 3 every 4 weeks. RESULTS: Forty-two patients have been 
      enrolled overall, including 19 in the dose-escalation part and 23 in the extended 
      pancreatic cancer cohort. Demographics were as follows: male-to-female ratio = 
      26:16; median age = 61 years (range 39-83 years); Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
      Group performance status 0:1:2 ratio = 16:21:5. The recommended dose of this 
      combination is sorafenib 400 mg twice daily and gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m2. The most 
      frequent grade 3 or 4 adverse events of all causalities were thrombocytopenia 
      (28.6%), lymphopenia (21.4%), lipase elevation (19%), neutropenia (16.7%), and 
      fatigue (14.3%). Antitumor activity was observed in both groups, with 2 (10.5%) 
      confirmed partial responses in ovarian cancer and 12 patients (63.2%) with 
      disease stabilization in the dose-escalation part; 13 patients (56.5%) achieved 
      disease stabilization in the pancreatic cohort. There was no consistent 
      pharmacokinetic drug-to-drug interaction between sorafenib and gemcitabine. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib and gemcitabine are well tolerated in combination; further 
      evaluations in pancreatic and ovarian cancers are warranted.

TI  - Sorafenib and everolimus in patients with advanced solid tumors and KRAS-mutated 
      NSCLC: A phase I trial with early pharmacodynamic FDG-PET assessment.
PG  - 4991-5007
LID - 10.1002/cam4.3131 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of patients with solid tumors and KRAS mutations remains 
      disappointing. One option is the combined inhibition of pathways involved in 
      RAF-MEK-ERK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR. METHODS: Patients with relapsed solid tumors were 
      treated with escalating doses of everolimus (E) 2.5-10.0 mg/d in a 14-day run-in 
      phase followed by combination therapy with sorafenib (S) 800 mg/d from day 15. 
      KRAS mutational status was assessed retrospectively in the escalation phase. 
      Extension phase included KRAS-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) only. 
      Pharmacokinetic analyses were accompanied by pharmacodynamics assessment of E by 
      FDG-PET. Efficacy was assessed by CT scans every 6 weeks of combination. RESULTS: 
      Of 31 evaluable patients, 15 had KRAS mutation, 4 patients were negative for KRAS 
      mutation, and the KRAS status remained unknown in 12 patients. Dose-limiting 
      toxicity (DLT) was not reached. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was defined as 
      7.5 mg/d E + 800 mg/d S due to toxicities at previous dose level (10 mg/d 
      E + 800 mg/d S) including leucopenia/thrombopenia III° and pneumonia III° 
      occurring after the DLT interval. The metabolic response rate in FDG-PET was 17% 
      on day 5 and 20% on day 14. No patient reached partial response in CT scan. 
      Median progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.25 and 
      5.85 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of patients with relapsed solid 
      tumors with 7.5 mg/d E and 800 mg/d S is safe and feasible. Early metabolic 
      response in FDG-PET was not confirmed in CT scan several weeks later. The 
      combination of S and E is obviously not sufficient to induce durable responses in 
      patients with KRAS-mutant solid tumors.

TI  - Sorafenib Decreases Tumor Exposure to an Anti-carcinoembryonic Antigen Monoclonal 
      Antibody in a Mouse Model of Colorectal Cancer.
PG  - 923-32
LID - 10.1208/s12248-016-9909-y [doi]
AB  - In this investigation, we test the hypothesis that treatment with sorafenib, an 
      anti-angiogenic agent, decreases tumor vascularization and, consequently, hinders 
      the delivery of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to xenograft tumors. Severe combined 
      immunodeficiency mice bearing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) expressing tumor 
      xenografts were divided into control and sorafenib-treated groups. Sorafenib was 
      administered to the latter group at 50 mg/kg IP every 48 h, starting 4 days 
      post-tumor implantation. When tumors attained a size of 200-300 mm(3), mice were 
      evaluated for (a) tumor microvessel density (using immunohistochemical analysis), 
      (b) tumor macromolecular extravasation (using Evans Blue Dye (EBD)), (c) 
      pharmacokinetics of an anti-CEA mAb, T84.66, following an intravenous dose of 
      10 mg/kg, and (d) intra-tumoral spatial distribution of T84.66 (using 
      autoradiography). Sorafenib treatment resulted in a substantial reduction in 
      tumor growth rate, a visible reduction in tumor microvessel density, and in a 
      46.4% decrease in EBD extravasation in tumor tissue (p < 0.0455). For control and 
      treated mice, no significant difference was found for the area under the mAb 
      plasma concentration-time curve (AUC(0-7d): 1.67 × 10(3) ± 1.28 × 10(2) vs. 
      1.76 × 10(3) ± 1.75 × 10(2) nM × day, p = 0.51). However, tumor AUC(0-7d) was 
      reduced by 40.8% in sorafenib-treated mice relative to that observed in control 
      mice (5.61 × 10(2) ± 4.27 × 10(1) vs. 9.48 × 10(2) ± 5.61 × 10(1) nM × day, 
      p < 0.001). Sorafenib therapy was also found to markedly alter mAb tumor spatial 
      distribution. The results collectively suggest that sorafenib treatment causes a 
      significant reduction in mAb delivery to, and distribution within, solid tumors.

TI  - Results of a Phase I trial of sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) in combination with 
      doxorubicin in patients with refractory solid tumors.
PG  - 866-73
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006), a novel, oral multi-kinase inhibitor, blocks 
      serine/threonine and receptor tyrosine kinases in the tumor and vasculature. 
      Sorafenib demonstrated single-agent activity in Phase I studies, and was 
      tolerated and inhibited tumor growth in combination with doxorubicin in 
      preclinical studies. This Phase I dose-escalation study determined the safety, 
      pharmacokinetics and efficacy of sorafenib plus doxorubicin. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: Thirty-four patients with refractory, solid tumors received doxorubicin 
      60 mg/m(2) on Day 1 of 3-week cycles, and oral sorafenib from Day 4 of Cycle 1 at 
      100, 200 or 400 mg bid. RESULTS: Common drug-related adverse events were 
      neutropenia (56%), hand-foot skin reaction (44%), stomatitis (32%), and diarrhea 
      (32%). The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. One patient with pleural 
      mesothelioma achieved a partial response (modified WHO criteria) and remained on 
      therapy for 39.7 weeks. Fifteen patients (48%) achieved stable disease for >/=12 
      weeks. Doxorubicin exposure increased moderately with sorafenib 400 mg bid. The 
      pharmacokinetics of sorafenib and doxorubicinol were not affected. CONCLUSION: 
      Sorafenib 400 mg bid plus doxorubicin 60 mg/m(2) was well tolerated. The 
      increased doxorubicin exposure with sorafenib 400 mg bid did not result in 
      significantly increased toxicity; low patient numbers make the clinical 
      significance of this unclear. These promising efficacy results justify further 
      clinical investigation.

TI  - Tolerability of oral sorafenib in pet dogs with a diagnosis of cancer.
PG  - 97-102
LID - 10.2147/VMRR.S149678 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib is a multi-target small molecule inhibitor of the RAF kinase family and 
      VEGFR-2/PDGFR. The US Food and Drug Administration approved sorafenib in human 
      patients with liver, thyroid, or renal carcinoma. The aim of this study was to 
      help guide future pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of sorafenib in dogs with a cancer 
      diagnosis. Client-owned dogs were eligible if they had a cytologic or histologic 
      diagnosis of cancer. Patients were enrolled at escalating doses of sorafenib. 
      Patients were evaluable for the study if they received at least one dose of 
      sorafenib and presented 1 week later for a follow-up examination, blood work, and 
      assessment of drug tolerability. The goal of this study was not to define a 
      maximum tolerated dose as may be reasonable in conventional cytotoxic 
      chemotherapy drugs, but rather to describe the tolerability of this drug in dogs 
      with a cancer diagnosis, as a prequel to future sorafenib PK studies. No patients 
      in the study had any evidence of adverse events that were attributable to 
      sorafenib. Doses of 3 mg/kg were well tolerated and associated with a suggestion 
      of clinical activity, supportive of future PK, and pharmacodynamic analysis. Such 
      future studies are recommended at this dose to define the associated exposure 
      achieved and determine a reasonable schedule for sorafenib administration.

AB  - Combining sorafenib and eribulin mesylate may provide synergistic antitumor 
      activities with limited overlapping toxicities. This phase 1b, open-label, 
      dose-escalation study evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics, maximum tolerated 
      dose/recommended phase 2 dose (MTD/RP2D), and preliminary efficacy of sorafenib 
      plus standard-dose eribulin mesylate in patients with advanced, metastatic, or 
      refractory tumors. Patients received sorafenib 200 mg twice daily (BID; n = 5), 
      600 mg/day (n = 8), and 400 mg BID (MTD; n = 27). Dose-limiting toxicities were 
      increased alanine aminotransferase and acute coronary syndrome (both grade 3) in 
      the 400-mg BID dose-escalation and expansion cohorts, respectively. No 
      significant increase in mean QTcF duration was observed with eribulin plus 
      sorafenib versus eribulin alone; there were no drug-drug interactions. Five 
      patients achieved partial response; 16 achieved stable disease. The combination 
      of sorafenib and eribulin mesylate presented no unexpected safety concerns and no 
      significant impact on QT/QTc intervals or drug-drug interactions. Sorafenib 400 
      mg BID plus standard-dose eribulin is the RP2D.

PG  - 1791-1799
LID - 10.1111/cas.13077 [doi]
AB  - This phase I, dose-escalation study evaluated the safety, preliminary efficacy 
      and pharmacokinetics of nintedanib, a triple angiokinase inhibitor, in Japanese 
      patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma and mild/moderate liver 
      impairment. Thirty patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma were 
      enrolled to groups, depending on whether liver impairment was mild (group I, 
      aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase ≤2× upper limit of normal 
      and Child-Pugh score 5 [n = 14] or 6 [n = 2]) or moderate (group II, Child-Pugh 
      score 5-6 and aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase >2× to ≤5× 
      upper limit of normal [n = 7] or Child-Pugh score 7 [n = 7]); 22 patients had 
      prior sorafenib treatment. Nintedanib was given twice daily in 28-day cycles 
      until disease progression or unacceptable adverse events, starting at 150 mg 
      (group I) or 100 mg (group II) and escalating to 200 mg. The primary objective 
      was to define the maximum tolerated dose based on occurrence of dose-limiting 
      toxicities during cycle 1 (grade ≥3 non-hematological and grade 4 hematological 
      adverse events). No dose-limiting toxicities were reported during cycle 1 and the 
      maximum tolerated dose for both groups was 200 mg twice daily. The most frequent 
      adverse events were gastrointestinal (diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and decreased 
      appetite). No patients discontinued nintedanib due to adverse events; 31% of 
      group I and 21% of group II had dose reductions. Median time to progression was 
      2.8 months (95% confidence interval, 1.05-5.52) for group I and 3.2 months (95% 
      confidence interval, 0.95-6.70) for group II. Nintedanib showed a manageable 
      safety profile and efficacy signals, including in patients previously treated 
      with sorafenib. Clinical trial registration NCT01594125; 1199.120

TI  - Phase ib of sorafenib in combination with everolimus in patients with advanced 
      solid tumors, selected on the basis of molecular targets.
PG  - 344-5
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2013-0335 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Molecular alterations of the PI3K and Ras pathways often occur in 
      human cancer. In this trial, the pharmacokinetics, toxicity, and activity of two 
      drugs inhibiting these pathways-everolimus and sorafenib-were investigated. 
      METHODS: Thirteen patients with progressing solid tumors were treated with 
      everolimus and sorafenib, according to a 3+3 scheme. Patients were selected on 
      the basis of immunohistochemical expression of tumor molecular targets, including 
      phospho-AKT, -p70S6K, and -ERK1/2. RESULTS: The daily recommended dose identified 
      was 2.5 mg of everolimus and 600 mg of sorafenib. Dose-limiting toxicities 
      included grade 3 asthenia and hand-foot skin reaction. No grade 4 adverse events 
      were observed. The most frequent grade 3 toxicities were hypophosphatemia 
      (30.8%), alanine aminotransferase level increase, asthenia, and anorexia (14%). 
      No pharmacokinetic interactions were identified between everolimus and sorafenib. 
      Of 12 evaluable patients, we observed 2 partial responses, with greater than 10% 
      shrinkage in an additional 5 patients. Objective responses were observed in one 
      patient with a thymoma and in one patient with a lung adenocarcinoma. Tumor 
      shrinkage that did not qualify as a partial response was seen in an abdominal 
      leiomyosarcoma and in adenoid cystic carcinomas. CONCLUSION: The combination of 
      everolimus and sorafenib is safe. The tumor activity observed in different tumor 
      types could be the result of the combined action of these drugs as well as the 
      molecular selection of the treated population. Further research is warranted to 
      better investigate drugs simultaneously blocking the PI3K and the Ras pathways 
      and to refine patient selection.

TI  - Variability of sorafenib toxicity and exposure over time: a 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis.
PG  - 1204-12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib displays major interpatient pharmacokinetic variability. It 
      is unknown whether the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib influence its toxicity. 
      METHODS: We analyzed the severity and kinetics of sorafenib-induced toxicities in 
      unselected consecutive patients with cancer, as well as their relationship with 
      biological, clinical, and pharmacokinetic parameters. Toxicity was recorded 
      bimonthly. Sorafenib plasma concentrations were assessed by liquid 
      chromatography. RESULTS: For 83 patients (median age, 62 years; range, 21-84 
      years), median sorafenib 12-hour area under the curve (AUC(0-12)) was 52.8 mg · 
      h/L (range: 11.8-199.6). A total of 51 patients (61%) experienced grade 3-4 
      toxicities, including hand-foot skin reactions (23%), asthenia (18%), and 
      diarrhea (11%). Sorafenib AUC(0-12) preceding grade 3-4 toxicities was 
      significantly higher than that observed in the remaining population (61.9 mg · 
      h/L vs. 53 mg · h/L). In 25 patients treated with fixed doses of sorafenib for 
      the first 4 months, median dose-normalized AUC(0-12) on day 120 was significantly 
      lower than on day 15 (63 vs. 102 mg · h/L). The incidence of hypertension and 
      hand-foot skin reactions significantly decreased over time. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib 
      AUC(0-12) decreases over time, similarly to the incidence of hypertension and 
      hand-foot skin reactions. Monitoring of sorafenib plasma concentrations may help 
      to prevent acute severe toxicities and detect patients with suboptimal exposure 
      at disease progression.

LID - 10.1002/cncr.25931 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to assess the maximum tolerated dose 
      (MTD), safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor effect of everolimus, 
      a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, in combination with sorafenib, a 
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell 
      carcinoma. METHODS: Sequential cohorts of patients received escalating doses of 
      everolimus and sorafenib in 28-day cycles in the absence of a dose-limiting 
      toxicity (DLT) or disease progression were examined. RESULTS: Twenty patients 
      with a median age of 65 years received therapy in 3 cohorts. Dose level 1 was 
      comprised of everolimus at a dose of 2.5 mg daily and sorafenib at a dose of 400 
      mg twice daily (6 patients), dose level 2 was comprised of everolimus at a dose 
      of 5 mg daily and sorafenib at a dose of 400 mg twice daily (8 patients), and 
      dose level 3 was comprised of everolimus at a dose of 10 mg daily and sorafenib 
      at a dose of 200 mg twice daily (6 patients). DLTs included grade 4 (according to 
      National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 
      3.0]) hyperuricemia with grade 2 gout and grade 3 lipase associated with grade 2 
      pancreatitis at dose level 2, and grade 3 rash in 2 patients at dose level 3. 
      Dose level 2 (everolimus at a dose of 5 mg daily and sorafenib at a dose of 400 
      mg twice daily) was established as the maximum tolerated dose. Treatment-related 
      adverse events occurring in >20% of patients included diarrhea, hand-foot 
      syndrome, hypertension, hypophosphatemia, hypothyroidism, and rash. Five of 20 
      patients achieved Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)-defined 
      partial responses, all of which occurred in patients without a history of prior 
      systemic therapy. Seven of 8 patients treated at dose level 2 experienced a 
      partial response or stable disease. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no 
      interaction between everolimus and sorafenib. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of 
      everolimus and sorafenib was associated with acceptable toxicity and evidence of 
      antitumor activity in previously untreated patients with metastatic renal cell 
      carcinoma.

TI  - A Phase Ib Study of Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) in Patients with Kaposi Sarcoma.
PG  - 505-e49
LID - 10.1634/theoncologist.2016-0486 [doi]
AB  - LESSONS LEARNED: Oral targeted agents are desirable for treatment of Kaposi 
      sarcoma (KS); however, in patients with HIV, drug-drug interactions must be 
      considered. In this study to treat KS, sorafenib was poorly tolerated at doses 
      less than those approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma and other cancers, and showed only modest 
      activity.Sorafenib's metabolism occurs via the CYP3A4 pathway, which is inhibited 
      by ritonavir, a commonly used antiretroviral agent used by most patients in this 
      study. Strong CYP3A4 inhibition by ritonavir may contribute to the observed 
      sorafenib toxicity.Alternate antiretroviral agents without predicted interactions 
      are preferred for co-administration in patients with HIV and cancers for which 
      sorafenib is indicated. BACKGROUND: We conducted a phase Ib study of sorafenib, a 
      vascular epithelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), c-kit, and platelet derived 
      growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-targeted treatment in Kaposi sarcoma (KS). We 
      evaluated drug-drug interactions between sorafenib and ritonavir, an HIV 
      medication with strong CYP3A4 inhibitory activity. METHODS: Two cohorts were 
      enrolled: HIV-related KS on ritonavir (Cohort R) and HIV-related or classical KS 
      not receiving ritonavir (Cohort NR). Sorafenib dose level 1 in cohort R (R1) was 
      200 mg daily and 200 mg every 12 hours in cohort NR (NR1). Steady-state 
      pharmacokinetics were evaluated at cycle 1, day 8. KS responses and correlative 
      factors were assessed. RESULTS: Ten patients (nine HIV(+)) were enrolled: R1 
      (eight), NR1 (two). Median CD4(+) count (HIV(+)) was 500 cells/µL. Dose-limiting 
      toxicities (DLTs) were grade 3 elevated lipase (R1), grade 4 thrombocytopenia 
      (R1), and grade 3 hand-foot syndrome (NR1). Two of seven evaluable patients had a 
      partial response (PR; 29%; 95% CI 4%-71%). Steady-state area under the curve of 
      the dosing interval (AUC(TAU)) of sorafenib was not significantly affected by 
      ritonavir; however, a trend for decreased AUC(TAU) of the CYP3A4 metabolite 
      sorafenib-N-oxide (3.8-fold decrease; p = .08) suggests other metabolites may be 
      increased. CONCLUSION: Sorafenib was poorly tolerated, and anti-KS activity was 
      modest. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors may contribute to sorafenib toxicity, and 
      ritonavir has previously been shown to be a CYP3A4 inhibitor. Alternate 
      antiretroviral agents without predicted interactions should be used when possible 
      for concurrent administration with sorafenib. The Oncologist 2017;22:505-e49.

PG  - 99-103
AB  - BAY 43-9006 is a selective Raf-1 kinase inhibitor with antitumor activity against 
      a variety of human cancers. A highly sensitive HPLC method for determination of 
      BAY 43-9006 in small volumes of serum (30 microl) was developed. Sample 
      preparation involved a liquid-liquid extraction procedure with tolnaftate as 
      internal standard followed by linear gradient elution at a reversed phase C18 
      column and UV detection. The method was selective and the calibration curves were 
      linear over the concentration range of 80-2000 ng/ml. The intra-day accuracy 
      ranged from 99.9 to 107.6% and the inter-day accuracy from 94.6 to 115%. The 
      lower limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 80 ng/ml with an accuracy of 105.8%. Thus, 
      this method has been validated and can be applied for the drug monitoring or 
      pharmacokinetic studies of BAY 43-9006 in small volumes of serum samples.

LID - 10.2217/pgs-2019-0127 [doi]
AB  - A 53-year-old woman with papillary thyroid cancer treated with 800 mg sorafenib 
      therapy rapidly experienced grade 3 toxicities. Dosing was reduced in a step-wise 
      manner with several treatment discontinuations down to 200 mg every 2 days but 
      severe toxicities continued. Plasma drug monitoring showed high exposure, even at 
      low dose. Dosing was then further reduced at 200 mg every 3 days and tolerance 
      was finally acceptable (i.e., grade 1 toxicity) with stable disease upon RECIST 
      imaging. Pharmacogenetic investigations showed polymorphisms affecting both 
      UGT1A9 (UGT1A9-rs3832043) and nuclear receptor PXR (NR1I2-rs3814055, 
      NR1I2-rs2472677 and NR1I2-rs10934498), possibly resulting in downregulation of 
      liver metabolizing enzymes of sorafenib (i.e., CYP and UGT). Patient's clearance 
      (0.48 l/h) estimated by Bayesian approach was consistently lower than usually 
      described. This is the first time that, in addition to mutations affecting 
      UGT1A9, genetic polymorphisms of NR1I2 have possibly been associated with both 
      plasma overexposure and severe toxicities upon sorafenib intake.

TI  - A quantitative HPLC-UV method for determination of serum sorafenib and sorafenib 
      N-oxide and its application in hepatocarcinoma patients.
PG  - 103-12
AB  - Sorafenib, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor, has been approved for treatment of 
      advanced renal-cell and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, 20% of HCC 
      patients taking sorafenib are forced to withdraw due to adverse effects within 
      one month after administration. Orally administered sorafenib is oxidatively 
      metabolized, predominantly by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), in small-intestinal 
      mucosa or liver. We aimed to characterize the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of 
      sorafenib in HCC patients and explore the contribution of the major metabolite 
      sorafenib N-oxide to adverse effects and therapeutic efficacy. We have therefore 
      developed a method for quantitative determination of sorafenib and its N-oxide in 
      the present study. To optimize the preanalytical procedure, we initially 
      ascertained the solubility of the analytes. Because they are lipophilic, solvents 
      containing more than 40% acetonitrile were required for efficient recovery. The 
      pretreatment procedure that we ultimately developed consists of acetonitrile 
      precipitation, followed by extraction using octadecyl silyl-silica gel to 
      eliminate water-soluble and hydrophilic components of serum. Application of this 
      procedure before HPLC enabled accurate and reproducible quantitation of analytes 
      in a linear range from 0.03 to 30 μg/mL. After characterizing the peaks in the 
      HPLC-ultraviolet chromatogram obtained from a medicated patient by LC-tandem mass 
      spectrometry, we applied this method to HCC patients taking sorafenib, showing 
      large inter-individual differences in the pharmacokinetic profile. In conclusion, 
      our assay system should be useful for follow-up of patients taking sorafenib and 
      for exploring the association between the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib and its 
      N-oxide and the adverse effects or therapeutic efficacy.

AB  - Sorafenib, an oral multi-kinase inhibitor, is the final therapy prior to 
      palliative care for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, due to its 
      adverse effects, 20% of patients must discontinue sorafenib within 1 month after 
      first administration. To identify ways to predict the adverse effects and 
      administer the drug for longer periods, we explored the relationship between the 
      duration of sorafenib treatment and the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib and its 
      major metabolite, sorafenib N-oxide. Twenty-five subjects enrolled in the study 
      were divided into two groups: patients with dosage reduced or withdrawn due to 
      adverse effects (n = 8), and patients with dosage maintained for 1 month after 
      initial administration (n = 17). We evaluated early sorafenib accumulation as the 
      area under the curve of sorafenib and sorafenib N-oxide concentrations during 
      days 1-7 (AUC(sorafenib) and AUC(N-oxide), respectively). Inter-group comparison 
      revealed that AUC(N-oxide) and AUC ratio (AUC(N-oxide)/AUC(sorafenib)) were 
      significantly higher in the dosage reduction/withdrawal group (P = 0.031 and P = 
      0.0022, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that 
      AUC(N-oxide) and AUC ratio were reliable predictors of adverse effects. When 
      patients were classified by cut-off points (AUC(N-oxide:) 2.0 μg ∙ day/mL, AUC 
      ratio: 0.13), progression-free survival was significantly longer in patients with 
      AUC(N-oxide) ≤ 2.0 μg ∙ day/mL (P = 0.0048, log-rank test). In conclusion, we 
      recommend to simultaneously monitor serum levels of sorafenib and its N-oxide 
      during the early stage after the first administration, which enables us to 
      provide safe and long-term therapy for each HCC patient with sorafenib.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if sorafenib is associated with an improved 4-month 
      probability of progression-free survival, using radiographic and clinical 
      criteria alone, in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. 
      Secondary endpoints included pharmacokinetics, toxicity analysis and overall 
      survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was an open-label, phase II, two-stage 
      design, focusing on the results from the second stage, as criteria for 
      progression were modified after completing the first stage. Sorafenib was given 
      at a dose of 400 mg orally twice daily in 28-day cycles. Clinical and laboratory 
      assessments were done every 4 weeks, and radiographic scans were obtained every 8 
      weeks. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were accrued in the second stage; the median 
      (range) age was 66 (49-85) years, the on-study prostate-specific antigen level 
      was 68.45 (5.8-995) ng/mL, the Gleason score 8 (6-9) and Eastern Cooperative 
      Oncology Group status 1 (in 17 patients). Of the 24 patients, 21 had previous 
      chemotherapy with docetaxel. All patients had bony metastases, either alone (in 
      11) or with soft-tissue disease (in 13). One patient had a partial response; 10 
      patients had stable disease (median duration 18 weeks, range 15-48). At a median 
      potential follow-up of 27.2 months, the median progression-free survival was 3.7 
      months and the median overall survival was 18.0 months. For the whole trial of 46 
      patients the median survival was 18.3 months. Most frequent toxicities included 
      hand-foot skin reaction (grade 2 in nine patients, grade 3 in three), rash, 
      abnormalities in liver function tests, and fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib has 
      moderate activity as a second-line treatment for metastatic castration-resistant 
      prostate cancer.

TI  - Axitinib for the management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
PG  - 113-26
LID - 10.2165/11591240-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, targeted agents have changed the treatment landscape for 
      patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), greatly improving treatment 
      outcomes. Several targeted agents are now licensed for the treatment of 
      metastatic RCC (mRCC), and a number of new agents are under investigation. 
      Axitinib, a small molecule indazole derivative is an oral, potent multitargeted 
      tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor, which selectively inhibits vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)-1, -2, and -3 at subnanomolar 
      concentrations, in vitro. In various nonclinical models, axitinib has 
      demonstrated in vivo target modulation and antiangiogenesis. In pharmacokinetic 
      studies, axitinib administered orally with food at the proposed regimen of 5 mg 
      twice daily continuous daily dosing, is rapidly absorbed, reaching peak 
      concentrations within 2-6 hours. Axitinib is metabolized primarily in the liver 
      via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system with less than 1% of the administered drug 
      passing unchanged in the urine. The pharmacokinetics of axitinib do not appear to 
      be altered by coadministered chemotherapies, and antacids do not have a 
      clinically significant effect. However, coadministration with CYP3A4 and 1A2 
      inducers is contraindicated. In addition, proton pump inhibitors reduce the rate 
      of axitinib absorption. Increased axitinib exposure is associated with higher 
      efficacy indicated by decreased tumor perfusion and volume. In three phase II 
      clinical trials in patients with advanced RCC previously treated with cytokines, 
      chemotherapy or targeted agents, axitinib has demonstrated antitumor activity 
      with a favorable non-cumulative toxicity profile. In one study of Western 
      patients with cytokine-refractory mRCC, an objective response rate (ORR) of 44.2% 
      (95% CI 30.5, 58.7) was achieved. The median time to progression was 15.7 months 
      (95% CI 8.4, 23.4) and the median overall survival (OS) was 29.9 months (95% CI 
      20.3, not estimable). In the second study of patients with sorafenib-refractory 
      mRCC, ORR was 22.6% (95% CI 12.9, 35.0). The median progression-free survival 
      (PFS) was 7.4 months (95% CI 6.7, 11.0) and a median OS of 13.6 months (95% CI 
      8.4, 18.8) was achieved. Results from the third study in Japanese patients with 
      cytokine-refractory mRCC reported an ORR of 55% and median PFS of 12.9 months 
      (95% CI 9.8, 15.6). In the three studies, the most common adverse events reported 
      were fatigue, hypertension, hand-foot syndrome (HFS), and gastrointestinal 
      toxicity, which were generally manageable with standard medical intervention. Of 
      note, the incidence of HFS and proteinuria in the Japanese study was higher than 
      that reported in the Western study in cytokine-refractory mRCC patients. An 
      observed association between diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg and increased 
      efficacy suggests potential use as a prognostic biomarker. However, this requires 
      further investigation. Two randomized phase III clinical trials are ongoing to 
      determine the efficacy of axitinib in patients with mRCC in the first- and 
      second-line setting. These results will help to determine the place of axitinib 
      in the mRCC treatment algorithm.

TI  - Tolerable sorafenib therapy for a renal cell carcinoma patient with hemodialysis: 
      a case study.
PG  - 512-4
LID - 10.1007/s10147-010-0070-9 [doi]
AB  - Sorafenib (Nexavar(®)) has been approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell 
      carcinoma (RCC) and hepatocellular carcinoma. There is little information on the 
      dosage adjustment of sorafenib for patients with end-stage renal failure. Herein, 
      we have examined the effect of hemodialysis on the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib 
      and its major active metabolite, M-2, and assessed sorafenib-related toxicity 
      throughout the therapy. The patient was a 54-year-old man who was diagnosed with 
      advanced RCC. Pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out on days 9 and 183. The 
      patient had stable disease on day 77 and showed progression on day 181. He has 
      received about 6 months of continuous treatment with sorafenib 800 mg/day without 
      any clinically relevant toxicity. The pharmacokinetic parameters of sorafenib 
      such as C (max) and AUC(0-12) on day 183 were in the range of the reference 
      values reported in patients with normal renal function. Our results suggest that 
      sorafenib administered at a dose of 400 mg twice per day was well tolerated, at 
      least for 6 months, for a patient undergoing hemodialysis.

AB  - The aim of this study was to prepare and evaluate Eudragit-based 
      microprecipitated bulk powder (MBP) formulations to enhance the oral 
      bioavailability of sorafenib. Cationic Eudragit E PO and anionic Eudragit S100 
      were selected for MBP preparation. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)-incorporated MBP 
      was also prepared to study the synergistic effect of UDCA in enhancing the 
      bioavailability of sorafenib. Sorafenib-loaded MBPs were successfully prepared by 
      a pH-controlled precipitation method using an aqueous antisolvent. 
      Submicron-sized particles of MBPs were observed by scanning electron microscopy, 
      and the amorphous form of sorafenib in MBPs was confirmed by powder X-ray 
      diffraction. MBPs of cationic and anionic Eudragits showed different in vitro 
      dissolution and pharmacokinetic profiles in rats. Sorafenib in Eudragit E 
      PO-based MBP (E PO-MBP) was rapidly dissolved at low pH conditions (pH 1.2 and 
      4.0), but was precipitated again at pH 4.0 within 4 h. Dissolution of sorafenib 
      from Eudragit S100-based MBP (S100-MBP) was high at pH 7.4 and did not 
      precipitate for up to 4 h. After oral administration to rats, all MBPs, compared 
      with powder, improved the oral absorption of sorafenib, with S100-MBP showing 
      1.5-fold higher relative oral bioavailability than E PO-MBP. Moreover, 
      incorporation of UDCA in S100-MBP (S100-UDCA-MBP) further increased the C(max) 
      and oral bioavailability of sorafenib, although the dissolution was not 
      significantly different from that of S100-MBP. Taken together, Eudragit-based MBP 
      formulations could be a promising strategy for enhancing the oral bioavailability 
      of sorafenib.

TI  - Novel transforming growth factor beta receptor I kinase inhibitor galunisertib 
      (LY2157299) in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 1468-1477
LID - 10.1111/liv.14113 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We assessed the activity of galunisertib, a small molecule 
      inhibitor of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β1) receptor I, in 
      second-line patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in two cohorts of 
      baseline serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP). METHODS: Patients with advanced HCC who 
      progressed on or were ineligible to receive sorafenib, Child-Pugh A/B7 and ECOG 
      PS ≤1 were enrolled into Part A (AFP ≥ 1.5× ULN) or Part B (AFP < 1.5× ULN). 
      Patients were treated with 80 or 150 mg galunisertib BID for 14 days per 28-day 
      cycle. Endpoints were time-to-progression (TTP) and changes in circulating AFP 
      and TGF-β1 levels, as well as safety, pharmacokinetics, progression-free survival 
      and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Patients (n = 149) were enrolled with median 
      age 65 years. Median TTP was 2.7 months (95% CI: 1.5-2.9) in Part A (n = 109) and 
      4.2 months (95% CI: 1.7-5.5) in Part B (n = 40). Median OS was 7.3 months (95% 
      CI: 4.9-10.5) in Part A and 16.8 months (95% CI: 10.5-24.4) in Part B. OS was 
      longer in AFP responders (>20% decrease from baseline, Part A) compared to 
      non-responders (21.5 months vs 6.8 months). OS was longer in TGF-β1 responders 
      (>20% decrease from baseline, all patients) compared to non-responders. The most 
      common Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were neutropenia (n = 4) and 
      fatigue, anaemia, increased bilirubin, hypoalbuminemia and embolism (each, 
      n = 2). CONCLUSIONS: Galunisertib treatment had a manageable safety profile in 
      patients with HCC. Lower baseline AFP and a response in AFP or TGF-β1 levels (vs 
      no response) correlated with longer survival. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: 
      NCT01246986 at ClinicalTrials.gov.

TI  - AC220 is a uniquely potent and selective inhibitor of FLT3 for the treatment of 
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
PG  - 2984-92
LID - 10.1182/blood-2009-05-222034 [doi]
AB  - Activating mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 are present in up to 
      approximately 30% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, implicating FLT3 as a 
      driver of the disease and therefore as a target for therapy. We report the 
      characterization of AC220, a second-generation FLT3 inhibitor, and a comparison 
      of AC220 with the first-generation FLT3 inhibitors CEP-701, MLN-518, PKC-412, 
      sorafenib, and sunitinib. AC220 exhibits low nanomolar potency in biochemical and 
      cellular assays and exceptional kinase selectivity, and in animal models is 
      efficacious at doses as low as 1 mg/kg given orally once daily. The data reveal 
      that the combination of excellent potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic 
      properties is unique to AC220, which therefore is the first drug candidate with a 
      profile that matches the characteristics desirable for a clinical FLT3 inhibitor.

AB  - Regorafenib has recently been approved for the treatment of colorectal cancer. A 
      bioanalytical liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric assay for this 
      multikinase inhibitor was developed and validated in plasma. The concentration 
      range of the assay was 25-25,000 ng/mL. Protein precipitation with acetonitrile 
      was used as sample pre-treatment with sorafenib as internal standard. The extract 
      was diluted with methanol (25%, v/v) and then injected onto the sub-2 µm 
      particle, bridged ethylsilicia hybrid trifunctional bonded C18 column. Isocratic 
      elution using 0.02% (v/v) formic acid in a methanol-water mixture was used. 
      Compounds were monitored by a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in the selected 
      reaction monitoring mode after positive electrospray ionization. Double 
      logarithmic calibration was used; within-day precisions, between-day precisions, 
      and accuracies were 3.2-9.2, 4.1-12.3 and 94.8-103.0%, respectively. High drug 
      stability was observed under all relevant storage conditions. The assay was used 
      to measure drug concentrations in a pharmacokinetic study in wild-type FVB mice.

TI  - A Novel Integrated Pharmacokinetic-Pharmacodynamic Model to Evaluate Combination 
      Therapy and Determine In Vivo Synergism.
PG  - 305-315
LID - 10.1124/jpet.121.000584 [doi]
AB  - Understanding pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) relationships is 
      essential in translational research. Existing PK-PD models for combination 
      therapy lack consideration of quantitative contributions from individual drugs, 
      whereas interaction factor is always assigned arbitrarily to one drug and 
      overstretched for the determination of in vivo pharmacologic synergism. Herein, 
      we report a novel generic PK-PD model for combination therapy by considering 
      apparent contributions from individual drugs coadministered. Doxorubicin (Dox) 
      and sorafenib (Sor) were used as model drugs whose PK data were obtained in mice 
      and fit to two-compartment model. Xenograft tumor growth was biphasic in mice, 
      and PD responses were described by three-compartment transit models. This PK-PD 
      model revealed that Sor (contribution factor = 1.62) had much greater influence 
      on overall tumor-growth inhibition than coadministered Dox (contribution factor = 
      0.644), which explains the mysterious clinical findings on remarkable benefits 
      for patients with cancer when adding Sor to Dox treatment, whereas there were 
      none when adding Dox to Sor therapy. Furthermore, the combination index method 
      was integrated into this predictive PK-PD model for critical determination of in 
      vivo pharmacologic synergism that cannot be correctly defined by the interaction 
      factor in conventional models. In addition, this new PK-PD model was able to 
      identify optimal dosage combination (e.g., doubling experimental Sor dose and 
      reducing Dox dose by 50%) toward much greater degree of tumor-growth inhibition 
      (>90%), which was consistent with stronger synergy (combination index = 0.298). 
      These findings demonstrated the utilities of this new PK-PD model and reiterated 
      the use of valid method for the assessment of in vivo synergism. SIGNIFICANCE 
      STATEMENT: A novel pharmacokinetic (PK)-pharmacodynamic (PD) model was developed 
      for the assessment of combination treatment by considering contributions from 
      individual drugs, and combination index method was incorporated to critically 
      define in vivo synergism. A greater contribution from sorafenib to tumor-growth 
      inhibition than that of coadministered doxorubicin was identified, offering 
      explanation for previously inexplicable clinical observations. This PK-PD model 
      and strategy shall have broad applications to translational research on 
      identifying optimal dosage combinations with stronger synergy toward improved 
      therapeutic outcomes.

TI  - A phase II study of the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of the MEK 
      inhibitor refametinib (BAY 86-9766) plus sorafenib for Asian patients with 
      unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 5976-85
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-3445 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: There is an unmet need for treatment options in hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC). Sorafenib is currently the only approved systemic treatment for HCC. 
      Refametinib, an oral, allosteric MEK inhibitor, has demonstrated antitumor 
      activity in combination with sorafenib in vitro and in vivo. A phase II study 
      evaluated efficacy and safety of refametinib plus sorafenib in Asian patients 
      with HCC (NCT01204177). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eligible patients received 
      twice-daily refametinib 50 mg plus twice-daily sorafenib 200 mg (morning)/400 mg 
      (evening), with dose escalation to sorafenib 400 mg twice daily from cycle 2 if 
      no grade ≥ 2 hand-foot skin reaction, fatigue, or gastrointestinal toxicity 
      occurred. Primary efficacy endpoint: disease control rate. Secondary endpoints: 
      time to progression, overall survival, pharmacokinetic assessment, biomarker 
      analysis, safety, and tolerability. RESULTS: Of 95 enrolled patients, 70 received 
      study treatment. Most patients had liver cirrhosis (82.9%) and hepatitis B viral 
      infection (75.7%). Disease control rate was 44.8% (primary efficacy analysis; n = 
      58). Median time to progression was 122 days, median overall survival was 290 
      days (n = 70). Best clinical responders had RAS mutations; majority of poor 
      responders had wild-type RAS. Most frequent drug-related adverse events were 
      diarrhea, rash, aspartate aminotransferase elevation, vomiting, and nausea. Dose 
      modifications due to adverse events were necessary in almost all patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Refametinib plus sorafenib showed antitumor activity in patients 
      with HCC and was tolerated at reduced doses by most patients. Frequent dose 
      modifications due to grade 3 adverse events may have contributed to limited 
      treatment effect. Patients with RAS mutations appear to benefit from 
      refametinib/sorafenib combination.

TI  - Organic anion transport polypeptide 1b2 selectively affects the pharmacokinetic 
      interaction between paclitaxel and sorafenib in rats.

AB  - Paclitaxel, a broad-spectrum antitumor drug, is widely used as a cytotoxic drug, 
      while sorafenib as a multi-kinase inhibitor is a classic targeted drug. A number 
      of clinical trials have combined paclitaxel and sorafenib for cancer treatment, 
      with the expectation of better therapeutic effects. However, the toxicity and 
      side effects in the treatment are significantly increased. In this report, the 
      organic anion transport polypeptide 1b2 (Oatp1b2) overexpression cell model and 
      the Oatp1b2 knockout (KO) rat model were used to investigate the drug-drug 
      interactions (DDI) between paclitaxel and sorafenib. In Oatp1b2-overexpressed 
      cells, sorafenib inhibited the uptake of paclitaxel in a concentration-dependent 
      manner. In wild-type (WT) rats, sorafenib increased the systemic exposure and 
      slowed the elimination of paclitaxel, resulting in DDI. In Oatp1b2 KO rats, 
      however, the DDI disappeared. Interestingly, paclitaxel did not alter the 
      pharmacokinetic profiles of sorafenib. Further studies found that sorafenib was 
      not the substrate of Oatp1b2 in rats. In general, the combination of paclitaxel 
      and sorafenib caused Oatp1b2-mediated DDI in vitro and in vivo, because sorafenib 
      inhibited Oatp1b2 activity and affected the pharmacokinetic properties of 
      paclitaxel. This study may provide useful information for understanding the role 
      of OATP1B in paclitaxel-sorafenib interaction.

TI  - Physiologically based pharmacokinetic models for everolimus and sorafenib in 
      mice.
PG  - 1219-29
LID - 10.1007/s00280-013-2116-y [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Everolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor approved 
      as an immunosuppressant and for second-line therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor used 
      as first-line therapy in HCC and RCC. This study assessed the pharmacokinetics 
      (PK) of everolimus and sorafenib alone and in combination in plasma and tissues, 
      developed physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models in mice, and 
      assessed the possibility of PK drug interactions. METHODS: Single and multiple 
      oral doses of everolimus and sorafenib were administered alone and in combination 
      in immunocompetent male mice and to severe combined immune-deficient (SCID) mice 
      bearing low-passage, patient-derived pancreatic adenocarcinoma in seven different 
      studies. Plasma and tissue samples including tumor were collected over a 24-h 
      period and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). 
      Distribution of everolimus and sorafenib to the brain, muscle, adipose, lungs, 
      kidneys, pancreas, spleen, liver, GI, and tumor was modeled as perfusion 
      rate-limited, and all data from the diverse studies were fitted simultaneously 
      using a population approach. RESULTS: PBPK models were developed for everolimus 
      and sorafenib. PBPK analysis showed that the two drugs in combination had the 
      same PK as each drug given alone. A twofold increase in sorafenib dose increased 
      tumor exposure tenfold, thus suggesting involvement of transporters in tumor 
      deposition of sorafenib. CONCLUSIONS: The developed PBPK models suggested the 
      absence of PK interaction between the two drugs in mice. These studies provide 
      the basis for pharmacodynamic evaluation of these drugs in patient-derived 
      primary pancreatic adenocarcinomas explants.

TI  - Phase I/II study of sorafenib in combination with temsirolimus for recurrent 
      glioblastoma or gliosarcoma: North American Brain Tumor Consortium study 05-02.
PG  - 1511-8
LID - 10.1093/neuonc/nos264 [doi]
AB  - The activity of single-agent targeted molecular therapies in glioblastoma has 
      been limited to date. The North American Brain Tumor Consortium examined the 
      safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of combination therapy with sorafenib, a 
      small molecule inhibitor of Raf, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, 
      and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β, and temsirolimus (CCI-779), an 
      inhibitor of mammalian target of rapamycin. This was a phase I/II study. The 
      phase I component used a standard 3 × 3 dose escalation scheme to determine the 
      safety and tolerability of this combination therapy. The phase II component used 
      a 2-stage design; the primary endpoint was 6-month progression-free survival 
      (PFS6) rate. Thirteen patients enrolled in the phase I component. The maximum 
      tolerated dosage (MTD) for combination therapy was sorafenib 800 mg daily and 
      temsirolimus 25 mg once weekly. At the MTD, grade 3 thrombocytopenia was the 
      dose-limiting toxicity. Eighteen patients were treated in the phase II component. 
      At interim analysis, the study was terminated and did not proceed to the second 
      stage. No patients remained progression free at 6 months. Median PFS was 8 weeks. 
      The toxicity of this combination therapy resulted in a maximum tolerated dose of 
      temsirolimus that was only one-tenth of the single-agent dose. Minimal activity 
      in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme was seen at the MTD of the 2 combined 
      agents.

TI  - Phase I/II study of S-1 in combination with sorafenib for metastatic renal cell 
      carcinoma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The potential of S-1 for the treatment of metastatic renal cell 
      carcinoma (mRCC) has been shown in two phase II studies. We aimed to assess the 
      safety, tolerance, pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of S-1 combined with 
      sorafenib in patients with mRCC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter, 
      single-arm, open-label, phase I/II study of S-1 plus sorafenib, we recruited 
      patients with clear-cell or papillary renal cell carcinoma who had received a 
      maximum of one prior cytokine-based regimen. The phase I primary end points were 
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD). S-1 was administered 
      orally at 60, 80, 100 or 120 mg/day on days 1-28 of a 42-day cycle in combination 
      with sorafenib (400 or 800 mg/day), given daily with dose adjustment. In phase 
      II, the primary end point was to assess the overall response rate (ORR) at the 
      RD. RESULTS: Nine patients were enrolled into phase I and 21 (including 6 
      patients who received the RD in the phase I portion) were enrolled into phase II. 
      In the phase I portion, the MTD could not be determined, and the RD was defined 
      as S-1 80 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-28 + sorafenib 800 mg/day on days 1-42. In the 
      phase II portion, 21 patients were fully assessable for efficacy and safety. The 
      confirmed ORR was 52% [95% confidence interval (CI) 29.8-74.3], including one 
      complete response (5%) and 10 partial responses (48%). The median 
      progression-free survival was 9.9 (95% CI 6.5-17.1) months. The most frequently 
      reported treatment-related adverse event for all grades was hand-foot skin 
      reaction (100%). The major reasons for dose reduction were hand-foot skin 
      reaction (38%) and rash (14%). CONCLUSION: Combination therapy with S-1 plus 
      sorafenib is effective and tolerable for patients with mRCC. However, skin events 
      management is important in S-1 plus sorafenib combination therapy.

TI  - Phase I trial of a combination of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib and the 
      farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib in advanced malignancies.
PG  - 7061-8
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-1241 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We evaluated the safety, maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetics, and 
      biological effects of the combination of the Raf-1, RET, KIT, platelet-derived 
      growth factor receptor, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 kinase 
      inhibitor sorafenib and the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib. 
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A standard 3 + 3 phase I dose-escalation design was used 
      with a 28-day cycle (sorafenib daily and tipifarnib for 21 days, by mouth). 
      RESULTS: Fifty patients were treated; 43 reached restaging evaluation after cycle 
      2. The most common side effects were grade 1 to 2 rash, hyperglycemia, and 
      diarrhea. Dose-limiting toxicity was rash, and the recommended phase II dose is 
      sorafenib 400 mg p.o. qam/200 mg p.o. qpm and tipifarnib p.o. 100 mg bd. Despite 
      the low doses of tipifarnib, one quarter of patients had > or =50% reduction in 
      farnesyltransferase levels. Interestingly, six of eight patients with medullary 
      thyroid cancer had durable stable disease (n = 3) or partial remissions (n = 3), 
      lasting 12 to 26+ months. Five of the six responders had available tissue, and 
      RET gene mutations were identified in them. Prolonged (> or =6 months) stable 
      disease was also seen in nine patients as follows: papillary thyroid cancer (n = 
      4; 18+ to 27+ months), adrenocortical cancer (n = 2; 7 and 11 months), and one 
      each of melanoma (platelet-derived growth factor receptor mutation positive; 14 
      months), renal (6 months), and pancreatic cancer (6 months). CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      study shows that the combination of tipifarnib and sorafenib is well tolerated. 
      Activity was seen, especially in patients with medullary thyroid cancer, a tumor 
      characterized by RET mutations.

TI  - Measurement of sorafenib plasma concentration by high-performance liquid 
      chromatography in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: is it useful 
      the application in clinical practice? A pilot study.
PG  - 335
LID - 10.1007/s12032-014-0335-7 [doi]
AB  - Pharmacokinetics and dose-finding studies on sorafenib were conducted on 
      heterogeneous groups of patients with solid tumors. Portal hypertension, gut 
      motility impairment and altered bile enterohepatic circulation may explain 
      different sorafenib toxicological profile in cirrhotic patients. This study 
      evaluated sorafenib plasma concentration in a homogeneous group of cirrhotic 
      patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Sorafenib concentrations were 
      determined by liquid chromatography in 12 consecutive patients. Data have been 
      evaluated by the generalized estimating equations method (p value statistical 
      level was set at α = 0.05). (1) There were not significant differences between 
      sorafenib concentrations in patients who tolerate the full dose versus patients 
      with reduced dose due to toxicity; (2) the average sorafenib concentrations 
      measured 3 h after the morning dosing were lower than those measured 12 h after 
      the evening dosing (p = 0.005); (3) sorafenib concentrations decrease overtime 
      (p < 10(-4)); (4) it has been found an association between the development of 
      severe adverse reactions and sorafenib concentrations (p < 10(-5)). The 
      relationship between dose and concentration of sorafenib in HCC patients is poor 
      and not clinically predictable, confirming the variability both in the maximum 
      tolerated dose and in plasma concentrations. Several factors may influence the 
      pharmacokinetics in patients with liver disease. This may explain the 
      inter-patient variability of concentrations and the lack of differences in 
      concentration at different dosages. It could be interesting to extend the series 
      of HCC patients to enhance information on the kinetics of the drug; furthermore, 
      to establish a threshold of plasma sorafenib concentrations to predict severe 
      adverse reactions would be clinically useful.

TI  - A phase I study of sorafenib in combination with S-1 plus cisplatin in patients 
      with advanced gastric cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib inhibits several receptor tyrosine kinases involved in 
      tumor progression and angiogenesis. S-1, an oral fluorouracil antitumor drug, 
      plus cisplatin (CDDP) is the standard regimen for advanced gastric adenocarcinoma 
      (AGC) in Japan. The purpose of this phase I study was to evaluate the safety, 
      pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of sorafenib in combination with S-1 
      plus CDDP. METHODS: Patients with histologically confirmed previously untreated 
      AGC were evaluated for eligibility and treated with sorafenib (400 mg bid, days 
      1-35), S-1 (40 mg/m(2) bid, days 1-21), and CDDP (60 mg/m(2), day 8). Treatment 
      was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
      Pharmacokinetics for sorafenib, 5-FU, and CDDP were investigated in cycle 1. 
      RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of the 
      study treatment. No specific or serious adverse event was newly reported in this 
      study. Five patients had partial response and 8 had stable disease as the best 
      response. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed no significant differences in the 
      exposures of sorafenib when administered alone or in combination with S-1 and 
      CDDP. CONCLUSIONS: The present phase I study demonstrates the acceptable toxicity 
      and preliminary efficacy of combined treatment with S-1, CDDP, and sorafenib.

AB  - Sorafenib (SR) is one of the most potent UGT (1A1, 1A9) inhibitors (in in vitro 
      tests). The inhibition of UGT1A1 may cause hyperbilirubinaemia, whereas the 
      inhibition of UGT1A9 and 1A1 may result in drug-drug interactions (DDIs). 
      Tapentadol (TAP) is a synthetic μ-opioid agonist and is used to treat moderate to 
      severe acute pain. Tapentadol is highly glucuronidated by the UGT1A9 and UGT2B7 
      isoenzymes. The aim of the study was to assess the DDI between SR and TAP. Wistar 
      rats were divided into three groups, with eight animals in each. The rats were 
      orally treated with SR (100 mg/kg) or TAP (4.64 mg/kg) or in combination with 100 
      mg/kg SOR and 4.64 TAP mg/kg. The concentrations of SR and sorafenib N-oxide, TAP 
      and tapentadol glucuronide were respectively measured by means of 
      high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet detection and by 
      means of ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The 
      co-administration of TAP with SR caused TAP maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) 
      to increase 5.3-fold whereas its area under the plasma concentration-time curve 
      (AUC(0-∞)) increased 1.5-fold. The tapentadol glucuronide C(max) increased 
      5.3-fold and whereas its AUC(0-∞) increased 2.0-fold. The tapentadol 
      glucuronide/TAP AUC(0-∞) ratio increased 1.4-fold (p = 0.0118). TAP also 
      increased SR C(max) 1.9-fold, whereas its AUC(0-∞) increased 1.3-fold. The 
      sorafenib N-oxide C(max) increased 1.9-fold whereas its AUC(0-∞) increased 
      1.3-fold. The sorafenib N-oxide/SR AUC(0-t) ratio increased 1.4-fold (p = 
      0.0127). The results show that the co-administration of sorafenib and tapentadol 
      increases the exposure to both drugs and changes their metabolism. In 
      consequence, the pharmacological effect may be intensified, but the toxicity may 
      increases, too.

TI  - A phase I multi-institutional study of systemic sorafenib in conjunction with 
      regional melphalan for in-transit melanoma of the extremity.
PG  - 3896-3905
LID - 10.1245/s10434-012-2373-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Isolated limb infusion with melphalan (ILI-M) corrected for ideal 
      body weight (IBW) is a well-tolerated treatment for patients with in-transit 
      extremity melanoma with an approximate 29 % complete response (CR) rate. 
      Sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, has been shown to augment tumor response to 
      chemotherapy in preclinical studies. METHODS: A multi-institutional, 
      dose-escalation, phase I study was performed to evaluate the safety and antitumor 
      activity of sorafenib in combination with ILI-M. Patients with AJCC stage 
      IIIB/IIIC/IV melanoma were treated with sorafenib starting at 400 mg daily for 
      7 days before and 7 days after ILI-M corrected for IBW. Toxicity, drug 
      pharmacokinetics, and tumor protein expression changes were measured and 
      correlated with clinical response at 3 months. RESULTS: A total of 20 patients 
      were enrolled at two institutions. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sorafenib 
      in combination with ILI-M was 400 mg. Four dose-limiting toxicities occurred, 
      including soft tissue ulcerations and compartment syndrome. There were three CRs 
      (15 %) and four partial responses (20 %). Of patients with the Braf mutation, 
      83 % (n = 6) progressed compared with only 33 % without (n = 12). Short-term 
      sorafenib treatment did alter protein expression as measured with reverse phase 
      protein array (RPPA) analysis, but did not inhibit protein expression in the MAP 
      kinase pathway. Sorafenib did not alter melphalan pharmacokinetics. CONCLUSION: 
      This trial defined the MTD of systemically administered sorafenib in combination 
      with ILI-M. Although some responses were seen, the addition of sorafenib to ILI-M 
      did not appear to augment the effects of melphalan but did increase regional 
      toxicity.

AB  - Sorafenib is a molecularly targeted drug used for treating hepatocellular 
      carcinoma. However, sorafenib may affect the function of normal hepatocytes, and 
      the clinical application of sorafenib is limited due to its adverse effects. The 
      aim of the current study was to improve the effectiveness of sorafenib by 
      preparing it as a nanoparticle formulation using nanoprecipitation technology. 
      Sorafenib was combined with a polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether-racemic 
      polylactic acid copolymer. The properties of the nanoparticles, including 
      particle size, ξ potential and release efficiency, were measured. The 
      pharmacokinetic profile, tissue distribution and tumor-inhibiting effects of the 
      nanoparticles were determined in vitro and in vivo. Compared with sorafenib, the 
      nanoparticle formulation exhibited a significant increase in in vivo retention 
      time. The concentration of sorafenib in tumor tissues was significantly higher 
      than that in normal tissues following treatment with sorafenib nanoparticles. 
      Sorafenib nanoparticles were more efficacious in inhibiting tumor growth compared 
      with sorafenib alone. The results, provided they can be extended to humans, 
      suggest that sorafenib nanoparticles may specifically target hepatocellular 
      carcinoma.

AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib, a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-2 and 
      RAF kinase inhibitor, commonly causes skin toxicity. We retrospectively analyzed 
      dermatologic toxicity in patients receiving combined antiangiogenic therapy 
      involving sorafenib and bevacizumab. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Castration-resistant 
      prostate cancer and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients were accrued 
      to phase II studies, receiving sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. A phase I study 
      explored sorafenib 200 to 400 mg twice daily with bevacizumab 5 to 10 mg/kg every 
      2 weeks in patients with advanced solid tumors. The probability of development of 
      maximum grade of dermatologic toxicity as a function of the cumulative dose of 
      sorafenib was determined. Additional analyses compared extent of toxicity, 
      pharmacokinetics, and patient risk factors. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients were 
      enrolled: 54 received sorafenib and 42 received bevacizumab/sorafenib. Hand-foot 
      skin reaction (HFSR) was observed in 50 of 96 (52%) patients. Grade 2 to 3 HFSR 
      developed in 16 of 54 (30%) sorafenib patients and 24 of 42 (57%) 
      bevacizumab/sorafenib patients (P=0.012) and was associated with cumulative 
      sorafenib exposure (P=0.0008). Twenty-four of 42 phase I patients randomized to 
      start with bevacizumab had increased risk of grade 2 to 3 HFSR than those 
      starting with sorafenib (P=0.013) after adjusting for association between HFSR 
      risk and hypertension (P=0.01), which was the only toxicity associated with HFSR. 
      There was no association between HFSR and baseline history of neuropathy, prior 
      taxane/platinum treatment, or systemic sorafenib levels. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Sorafenib-related HFSR is associated with increasing cumulative sorafenib dose. 
      HFSR is increased in patients treated with bevacizumab/sorafenib combination 
      anti-VEGF therapy, and this finding is not explained by pharmacokinetic 
      interaction between the two agents. Our results suggest that the pathophysiology 
      of HFSR may be related to VEGF inhibition.

TI  - Exposure-toxicity relationship of sorafenib in Japanese patients with renal cell 
      carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 185-96
LID - 10.1007/s40262-013-0108-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Sorafenib has various adverse events that can cause 
      treatment discontinuation or dose reduction. The aim of this study was to compare 
      the safety profile between renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) patients receiving sorafenib under real-life practice conditions. 
      Furthermore, we investigated the relationship between sorafenib exposure and 
      clinical outcomes. METHODS: A total of 91 Japanese cancer patients (RCC, n = 21; 
      HCC, n = 70) treated with sorafenib were enrolled. Toxicity was graded according 
      to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events 
      (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.0. Single blood samples were collected at each clinic visit 
      and serum sorafenib concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem 
      mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The incidence of adverse events was analyzed 
      according to cancer type and sorafenib concentration. RESULTS: Hand-foot skin 
      reaction (HFSR) was the most common adverse event among RCC (76 %) and HCC (66 %) 
      patients. Elevations in hepatic transaminases and pancreatic amylase developed 
      more frequently in patients with RCC than in those with HCC (p < 0.05), while 
      hyperbilirubinemia and thrombocytopenia were observed more often in HCC patients 
      than in RCC patients (p < 0.05). Pharmacokinetic data were available from 52 
      patients (RCC, n = 16; HCC, n = 36). HCC patients showed significantly higher 
      dose-normalized concentrations than RCC patients (p = 0.0184). Sorafenib 
      concentrations were significantly greater in patients with grade ≥2 HFSR and 
      hypertension than in those not experiencing the adverse events (p = 0.0045 and 
      0.0453, respectively). Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic curves 
      revealed optimal cutoff concentrations of sorafenib to predict grade ≥2 HFSR 
      (5.78 μg/mL) and hypertension (4.78 μg/mL). In addition, a trend of prolonged 
      overall survival was observed in HCC patients who achieved a maximal sorafenib 
      concentration of ≥4.78 μg/mL during treatment compared with those who did not 
      achieve the threshold concentration (12.0 vs. 6.5 months; log-rank p = 0.0824). 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that the safety and 
      pharmacokinetic profiles of sorafenib differ between Japanese cancer patients 
      with RCC and HCC. Furthermore, the serum sorafenib concentration could be used as 
      a guide to avoiding the development of severe HFSR while allowing prediction of 
      the incidence of grade ≥2 hypertension in patients with RCC and HCC, and may 
      potentially be related to the clinical efficacy of sorafenib for HCC.

TI  - Phase I trial of preoperative chemoradiation plus sorafenib for high-risk 
      extremity soft tissue sarcomas with dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI correlates.
PG  - 6902-11
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-1594 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We conducted a phase I trial of the addition of sorafenib to a 
      chemoradiotherapy regimen in patients with high-risk (intermediate/high grade, >5 
      cm) extremity soft tissue sarcoma undergoing limb salvage surgery. We conducted a 
      correlative study of quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) to 
      assess response to treatment. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients were treated at 
      increasing dose levels of sorafenib (200 mg daily, 400 mg daily, 400 mg twice 
      daily) initiated 14 days before three preoperative and three postoperative cycles 
      of epirubicin/ifosfamide. Radiation (28 Gy) was administered during cycle 2 with 
      epirubicin omitted. The primary objective was to determine the maximum tolerated 
      dose (MTD) of sorafenib. DCE-MRI was conducted at baseline, after 2 weeks of 
      sorafenib, and before surgery. The imaging data were subjected to quantitative 
      pharmacokinetic analyses. RESULTS: Eighteen subjects were enrolled, of which 16 
      were evaluable. The MTD of sorafenib was 400 mg daily. Common grade 3-4 adverse 
      events included neutropenia (94%), hypophosphatemia (75%), anemia (69%), 
      thrombocytopenia (50%), and neutropenic fever/infection (50%). Of note, 38% 
      developed wound complications requiring surgical intervention. The rate of ≥95% 
      histopathologic tumor necrosis was 44%. Changes in DCE-MRI biomarker ΔK(trans) 
      after 2 weeks of sorafenib correlated with histologic response (R(2) = 0.67, P = 
      0.012) at surgery. CONCLUSION: The addition of sorafenib to preoperative 
      chemoradiotherapy is feasible and warrants further investigation in a larger 
      trial. DCE-MRI detected changes in tumor perfusion after 2 weeks of sorafenib and 
      may be a minimally invasive tool for rapid assessment of drug effect in soft 
      tissue sarcoma.

PG  - 144-7
LID - 10.1016/j.jchromb.2012.02.010 [doi]
AB  - A bioanalytical assay for the mutated BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib was developed 
      and validated. For the quantitative assay, human plasma samples were pre-treated 
      using protein precipitation with water-acetonitrile (1/3, v/v) containing 
      sorafenib as internal standard. The extract was directly injected into the 
      chromatographic system. This system consisted of a sub-2 μm particle, 
      trifunctional bonded octadecyl silica column with isocratic elution using 0.01% 
      (v/v) of formic acid in a mixture of water and methanol. The eluate was 
      transferred into the electrospray interface with positive ionization and the 
      analyte was detected in the selected reaction monitoring mode of a triple 
      quadrupole mass spectrometer. The assay was validated in a 0.1-100 μg/ml 
      calibration range. Within day precisions were 1.6-3.2%, between day precisions 
      2.7% and 8.2% and accuracies were between 99% and 106% for the whole calibration 
      range. The drug was stable under all relevant conditions. Finally, the assay was 
      successfully used to assess drug levels in a pharmacokinetic mouse study.

TI  - New 2,4-disubstituted-2-thiopyrimidines as VEGFR-2 inhibitors: Design, synthesis, 
      and biological evaluation.
PG  - e1900089
LID - 10.1002/ardp.201900089 [doi]
AB  - A new series of 2,4-disubstituted-2-thiopyrimidines 6a-t, 9a, and 9b was 
      efficiently designed and synthesized as antiangiogenic and cytotoxic agents. 
      Compounds 6j, 6l, and 6d showed IC(50) values of 1.23, 3.78, and 3.84 μM, 
      respectively, against the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 
      (VEGFR-2). Most of the synthesized 2-thiouracils showed antiproliferative 
      activity against the HepG2 cell line (hepatocellular carcinoma) in the micromolar 
      range, for instance, 9b, 6l, 6m, 6n, and 6j displayed IC(50)  = 7.92, 8.35, 8.51, 
      9.59, and 13.06 μM, respectively, relative to sorafenib (III; IC(50) 
       = 10.99 μM). Also, compounds 6j, 9a, 6m, and 6s (IC(50)  = 15.21, 16.96, 17.68, 
      and 18.15 μM, respectively) are the most potent compounds against the UO-31 cell 
      line. Further evaluation of the effect of the synthesized candidates on VEGFR-2 
      in the HepG2 cell line demonstrated that compounds 6j and 6l exhibit VEGFR-2 
      inhibitory activity of 87% and 84%, respectively, relative to sorafenib (III; 
      92%). In silico docking of the synthesized hits into the binding site of VEGFR-2 
      showed their ability to perform the main binding interactions with the key amino 
      acids in the binding site. Studying the in silico predicted ADME (absorption, 
      distribution, metabolism, and excretion) parameters for the synthesized 
      thiouracils demonstrated that they have favorable pharmacokinetic and 
      drug-likeness properties. These results demonstrate that the 2,4-disubstituted 
      thiouracils 6 and 9 have not only favorable antiangiogenic and antiproliferative 
      activity but also satisfy the criteria required for the development of orally 
      bioavailable drugs. Consequently, they represent a biologically active scaffold 
      that should be further optimized for future discovery of potential hits.

TI  - Correlation between clinical response to sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma 
      treatment and polymorphisms of P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) and of breast cancer 
      resistance protein (ABCG2): monocentric study.
PG  - 759-766
LID - 10.1007/s00280-017-3268-y [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We studied the relation between the polymorphism of P-glycoprotein 
      (P-gp) and of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), encoded by ABCB1 and ABCG2 
      genes, respectively, and the pharmacokinetic variability and clinical response 
      during the treatment with sorafenib of hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: At the 
      Paul Brousse Hospital in Villejuif, France, 47 consecutive patients with advanced 
      HCC treated with a single agent sorafenib, were enrolled. Sorafenib exposure was 
      measured by its plasma concentration 3 h after oral administration of 400 mg 
      (bid) by liquid chromatography. All enrolled patients were genotyped for ABCB1 
      (rs2032582; rs1045642) and ABCG2 (rs2231137; rs2231142; rs2622604) by blood 
      genomic DNA extraction and Mass ARRAY genotyping. The clinical response was 
      evaluated after 3months of treatment according to the RECIST criteria. KEY 
      FINDINGS: Significant associations between sorafenib exposure and the studied 
      polymorphisms were observed for ABCB1 3435C>T, ABCG2 34G>A, ABCG2 1143C>T and 
      ABCG2 421C>A, but not for ABCB1 2677G>TA SNP. In heterozygous patients for ABCB1 
      3435 C>T, ABCG2 34 G>A and ABCG2 1143 C>T polymorphisms were significantly 
      associated with the lowest sorafenib plasma levels. Those patients presented a 
      tendency to have the best clinical evolution. CONCLUSION: Heterozygous forms of 
      the studied polymorphisms could be associated with a better therapeutic response.

TI  - Sorafenib exposure and its correlation with response and safety in advanced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma: results from an observational retrospective study.
PG  - 129-139
LID - 10.1007/s00280-020-04105-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Severe adverse events frequently occur in patients treated with 
      sorafenib, whereas some patients have suboptimal response to sorafenib. We aimed 
      to evaluate the association of sorafenib-induced toxicities and clinical outcomes 
      with the pharmacokinetics of sorafenib in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC). METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study in which 26 HCC 
      patients who had been treated with sorafenib were enrolled between September 2010 
      and March 2015. The association between trough sorafenib concentration and 
      occurrence of grade ≥ 3 toxicities was evaluated. In addition, we estimated the 
      association of trough sorafenib concentration with overall survival (OS). 
      RESULTS: The median sorafenib concentration was 2.91 μg/mL (range 
      0.74-8.8 μg/mL). Based on the receiver operating characteristic curve, the 
      threshold value of the trough sorafenib concentration for predicting grade ≥ 3 
      toxicities and responder (complete response or partial response at best response, 
      or stable disease for ≥ 3 months) was 3.45 μg/mL [area under the curve (AUC) 
      0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54-0.93; p <0.05] and 1.40 μg/mL (AUC 0.97, 
      95% CI 0.97-1.00; p <0.05), respectively. OS of patients with sorafenib 
      1.40-3.45 µg/mL had a tendency to be longer than those of patients 
      administered < 1.40 μg/mL and ≥ 3.45 μg/mL [median 17.8 months (1.40-3.45 μg/mL) 
      vs. 5.3 months (< 1.40 μg/mL) and 9.5 months (≥ 3.45 μg/mL)]. CONCLUSIONS: From 
      results of this study, we proposed that the target range of sorafenib may be a 
      trough concentration of 1.40-3.45 μg/mL in patients with HCC.

      phase 1/2 study.
PG  - 2
LID - 10.1186/2051-1426-2-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the positive impact of targeted therapies on metastatic renal 
      cell carcinoma (mRCC), durable responses are infrequent and an unmet need exists 
      for novel therapies with distinct mechanisms of action. We investigated the 
      combination of recombinant Interleukin 21 (IL-21), a cytokine with unique 
      immunostimulatory properties, plus sorafenib, a VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. 
      METHODS: In this phase 1/2 study, 52 mRCC patients received outpatient treatment 
      with oral sorafenib 400 mg twice daily plus intravenous IL-21 (10-50 mcg/kg) on 
      days 1-5 and 15-19 of each 7-week treatment course. The safety, antitumor 
      activity, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of the combination were 
      evaluated. RESULTS: In phase 1 (n = 19), the maximum tolerated dose for IL-21 
      with the standard dose of sorafenib was determined to be 30 mcg/kg/day; grade 3 
      skin rash was the only dose-limiting toxicity. In phase 2, 33 previously-treated 
      patients tolerated the combination therapy well with appropriate dose reductions; 
      toxicities were mostly grade 1 or 2. The objective response rate was 21% and 
      disease control rate was 82%. Two patients have durable responses that are 
      ongoing, despite cessation of both IL-21 and sorafenib, at 41+ and 30+ months, 
      respectively. The median progression-free survival in phase 2 was 5.6 months. The 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of IL-21 appeared to be preserved 
      in the presence of sorafenib. CONCLUSION: IL-21 plus sorafenib has antitumor 
      activity and acceptable safety in previously treated mRCC patients. IL-21 may 
      represent a suitable immunotherapy in further exploration of combination 
      strategies in mRCC. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:

AB  - In this study, a Soluplus-coated colloidal silica nanomatrix (SCCSN) formulation 
      for the entrapment of poorly water-soluble drugs was devised. The maximum 
      supersaturation of the drug-loaded nanomatrix was higher than that of a physical 
      mixture as indicated by the results of in vitro kinetic solubility studies. For 
      atorvastatin calcium, dutasteride, and sorafenib tosylate, there were 2.8-, 326-, 
      and 46.4-fold increases in solubility, respectively. For dutasteride, a promising 
      4.7-fold increase for in vivo oral drug absorption in the entrapped nanomatrix 
      was observed as compared to the free physical mixture, supported by statistical 
      significance testing of pharmacokinetic parameters.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the role of ontogeny in sorafenib metabolism to the 
      equipotent active metabolite sorafenib N-oxide. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Steady-state 
      pharmacokinetic studies of sorafenib and metabolites were conducted in 30 
      children and young adults (17 males; median age, 9.5 years) receiving sorafenib 
      150 mg/m(2) or 200 mg/m(2) twice daily. Sorafenib metabolism was evaluated in 
      vitro at 10 μmol/L using a panel of purified human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. 
      Sorafenib metabolism and CYP3A4 expression was evaluated in 52 human liver 
      samples from donors of ≤20 years old. The drug-drug interaction potential between 
      sorafenib and azole antifungal agents was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. 
      RESULTS: No age-related differences in sorafenib apparent oral clearance were 
      observed. Mean sorafenib N-oxide metabolite ratio was 0.27 ± 0.14. In children of 
      ≤10 years of age, boys had approximately 2-fold higher N-oxide ratios than girls 
      (0.40 ± 0.15 vs. 0.22 ± 0.12, P = 0.026). Of the CYPs evaluated, sorafenib was 
      exclusively metabolized to sorafenib N-oxide by CYP3A4. A trend for increased 
      N-oxide formation in boys was observed in liver samples, which correlated with 
      CYP3A4 mRNA expression. Posaconazole and voriconazole potently inhibited 
      sorafenib N-oxide formation in vitro, and reduced sorafenib N-oxide formation in 
      3 children given sorafenib concurrent with azoles. CONCLUSION: We have identified 
      several factors affecting interpatient variability in sorafenib metabolism to the 
      active N-oxide metabolite including age, sex, and concurrent treatment with azole 
      antifungals. This knowledge may provide important considerations for the clinical 
      use of sorafenib in children and possibly other kinase inhibitors undergoing 
      CYP3A4-mediated metabolism.

TI  - A Phase I/Randomized Phase II Study to Evaluate the Safety, Pharmacokinetics, and 
      Efficacy of Nintedanib versus Sorafenib in Asian Patients with Advanced 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 165-178
LID - 10.1159/000486460 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nintedanib is an oral, triple angiokinase inhibitor of vascular 
      endothelial growth factor/platelet-derived growth factor/fibroblast growth factor 
      receptors. This randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase I/II study evaluated 
      the safety, pharmacokinetics, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in terms of 
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and efficacy of nintedanib versus sorafenib in 
      Asian patients with unresectable advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: For the phase I portion, patients were stratified into two 
      groups according to their alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase 
      (ALT/AST) and Child-Pugh score at baseline. For phase I, the primary endpoint was 
      determination of the MTD in terms of DLTs. For phase II, patients with a 
      Child-Pugh score of 5-6, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score 
      ≤2, and an ALT/AST ≤2× the upper limit of normal were enrolled and randomized 2: 
      1 to nintedanib 200 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) (the MTD determined in phase I) or 
      sorafenib 400 mg b.i.d. continuously in 28-day cycles until intolerable adverse 
      events (AEs) or disease progression (PD); treatment beyond PD was allowed if 
      clinical benefit was perceived. The primary endpoint for phase II was time to 
      progression (TTP) by central independent review (CIR; by Response Evaluation 
      Criteria in Solid Tumors v1.0); the secondary endpoints included overall survival 
      (OS). All analyses were exploratory. RESULTS: The MTD was 200 mg in both groups. 
      For phase II, 95 patients were randomized to nintedanib (n = 63) or sorafenib (n 
      = 32). For nintedanib and sorafenib, respectively, the median CIR TTP was 2.8 vs. 
      3.7 months (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73-2.01) and 
      the median OS 10.2 vs. 10.7 months (HR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.59-1.49). 
      Nintedanib-treated patients had fewer grade 3 or higher AEs (56 vs. 84%), serious 
      AEs (46 vs. 56%), and AEs leading to dose reduction (19 vs. 59%) and drug 
      discontinuation (24 vs. 34%). AEs associated more frequently with nintedanib were 
      vomiting and nausea, whereas those associated more frequently with sorafenib were 
      ALT/AST increases, diarrhea, rash, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia 
      syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Nintedanib showed numerically similar efficacy to 
      sorafenib for CIR TTP and OS in Asian patients with advanced HCC and adequate 
      liver function. AEs were generally manageable.

TI  - Safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of sorafenib: a 
      review of four phase I trials in patients with advanced refractory solid tumors.
PG  - 426-37
AB  - Sorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that inhibits Raf serine/threonine 
      kinases and receptor tyrosine kinases involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis. 
      It has demonstrated preclinical and clinical activity in several tumor types. 
      Sorafenib 400 mg twice daily (bid) has been approved in several countries 
      worldwide for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. This review summarizes key 
      safety, pharmacokinetic, and efficacy data from four phase I, single-agent, 
      dose-escalation studies with sorafenib in patients with advanced refractory solid 
      tumors (n = 173). These trials followed different treatment regimens (7 days on/7 
      days off, n = 19; 21 days on/7 days off, n = 44; 28 days on/7 days off, n = 41; 
      or continuous dosing, n = 69) to establish the optimum dosing schedule. Sorafenib 
      was generally well tolerated; most adverse events were mild to moderate in 
      severity up to the defined maximum-tolerated dose of 400 mg twice daily (bid). 
      The most frequently reported drug-related adverse events at any grade included 
      fatigue (40%), anorexia (35%), diarrhea (34%), rash/desquamation (27%), and 
      hand-foot skin reaction (25%). Sorafenib demonstrated preliminary antitumor 
      activity, particularly among patients with renal cell carcinoma or hepatocellular 
      carcinoma: overall, two of 137 evaluable patients achieved partial responses and 
      38 (28%) had stable disease. Although there was high interpatient variability in 
      plasma pharmacokinetics across these studies, this was not associated with an 
      increased incidence or severity of toxicity. Preliminary studies suggest that 
      phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase in tumor cells or peripheral 
      blood lymphocytes may be a useful biomarker for measuring and, ultimately, 
      predicting the effects of sorafenib. Based on these findings, continuous daily 
      400 mg bid sorafenib was chosen as the optimal regimen for phase II/III studies. 
      Trials are ongoing in renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, melanoma, 
      and non-small cell lung cancer.

TI  - Clinical pharmacokinetics of tyrosine kinase inhibitors: focus on pyrimidines, 
      pyridines and pyrroles.
PG  - 551-603
LID - 10.2165/11593320-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - Pyrimidine (imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib and pazopanib), pyridine (sorafenib) 
      and pyrrole (sunitinib) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are multi-targeted TKIs 
      with high activity towards several families of receptor and non-receptor tyrosine 
      kinases involved in angiogenesis, tumour growth and metastatic progression of 
      cancer. These orally administered TKIs have quite diverse characteristics with 
      regard to absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Absolute bioavailability in 
      humans has been investigated only for imatinib (almost 100%) and pazopanib 
      (14-39%; n = 3). On the basis of human radioactivity data, dasatinib is 
      considered to be well absorbed after oral administration (19% and 0.1% of the 
      total radioactivity were excreted as unchanged dasatinib in the faeces and urine, 
      respectively). Quite low absolute bioavailability under fasted conditions is 
      assumed for nilotinib (31%), sorafenib (50%) and sunitinib (50%). Imatinib, 
      dasatinib and sunitinib exhibit dose-proportional increases in their area under 
      the plasma concentration-time curve values over their therapeutic dose ranges. 
      Less than dose-proportional increases were observed for nilotinib at doses 
      ≥400 mg/day and for sorafenib and pazopanib at doses ≥800 mg/day. At steady 
      state, the accumulation ratios are 1.5-2.5 (unchanged imatinib), 2.0 (nilotinib 
      once-daily dosing), 3.4 (nilotinib twice-daily dosing), 1.2-4.5 (pazopanib), 
      5.7-6.4 (sorafenib) and 3.0-4.5 (sunitinib). Concomitant intake of a high-fat 
      meal does not alter exposure to imatinib, dasatinib and sunitinib but leads to 
      considerably increased bioavailability of nilotinib and pazopanib and decreased 
      bioavailability of sorafenib. With the exception of pazopanib, the TKIs described 
      here have large apparent volumes of distribution, exceeding the volume of body 
      water by at least 4-fold. Very low penetration into the central nervous system in 
      humans has been reported for imatinib and dasatinib, but there are currently no 
      published human data for nilotinib, pazopanib, sorafenib or sunitinib. All TKIs 
      that have been described are more than 90% bound to the plasma proteins: 
      α(1)-acid glycoprotein and/or albumin. They are metabolized primarily via 
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, the only exception being sorafenib, for which uridine 
      diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A9 is the other main enzyme involved. Active 
      metabolites of imatinib and sunitinib contribute to their antitumour activity. 
      Although some patient demographics have been identified as significant co-factors 
      that partly explain interindividual variability in exposure to TKIs, these 
      findings have not been regarded as sufficient to recommend age-, sex-, 
      bodyweight- or ethnicity-specific dose adjustment. Systemic exposure to imatinib, 
      sorafenib and pazopanib increases in patients with hepatic impairment, and 
      reduction of the initial therapeutic dose is recommended in this subpopulation. 
      The starting dose of imatinib should also be reduced in renally impaired 
      subjects. Because the solubility of dasatinib is pH dependent, co-administration 
      of histamine H(2)-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors with dasatinib 
      should be avoided. With the exception of sorafenib, systemic exposure to TKIs is 
      significantly decreased/increased by co-administration of potent CYP3A4 
      inducers/inhibitors, and so it is strongly recommended that the TKI dose is 
      adjusted or that such co-administration is avoided. Caution is also recommended 
      for co-administration of CYP3A4 substrates with TKIs, especially for those with a 
      narrow therapeutic index. However, current recommendations with regard to dose 
      adjustment of TKIs need to be validated in clinical studies. Further 
      investigations are needed to explain the large interindividual variability in the 
      pharmacokinetics of these drugs and to assess theclinical relevance of their 
      interaction potential and inhibitory effects on metabolizing enzymes and 
      transporters.

TI  - Proposal of a prediction model describing the metabolic interaction between 
      warfarin and sorafenib using a population pharmacokinetic approach.
PG  - 202-215
LID - 10.5414/CP203826 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We attempted to examine the applicability of a population 
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model describing the metabolic 
      interaction between warfarin and sorafenib due to CYP2C9 inhibition and to 
      predict the plasma concentrations of sorafenib and S-warfarin, the international 
      normalized ratio (INR), and the optimal maintenance dose of warfarin in the 
      presence of sorafenib in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sorafenib inhibition 
      constant for S-warfarin metabolism was determined in vitro, and the unbound 
      fraction in the liver was estimated using the published equations. A population 
      PK-PD model describing the interaction between warfarin and sorafenib assuming 
      competitive metabolic inhibition of S-warfarin by sorafenib was developed using 
      NONMEM. The model was evaluated using clinical data and INR collected from the 
      literature. RESULTS: The observed time courses of INR retrieved from Japanese and 
      Caucasian patients given warfarin and sorafenib were mostly within the 90% range 
      of the predicted values. Then, we predicted the plasma sorafenib and S-warfarin 
      concentrations and INR after administration of warfarin (3 mg/day) alone and 
      warfarin + sorafenib (800 mg/day). The predicted mean plasma S-warfarin 
      concentration and INR at steady state were almost 6 and 2 times greater, 
      respectively, in the presence of sorafenib than those for warfarin alone. The 
      predicted S-warfarin concentrations and INR after reduction of the warfarin dose 
      (0.5 mg/day) in the presence of sorafenib were comparable to those after 3 mg/day 
      warfarin alone. CONCLUSION: The proposed population PK-PD model has the potential 
      to predict an increase in INR quantitatively after concurrent administration of 
      warfarin and sorafenib.

TI  - Activity of the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib in combination with cytarabine in 
      acute myeloid leukemia.
PG  - 893-905
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djr107 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically heterogeneous cancer 
      that frequently exhibits aberrant kinase signaling. We investigated a treatment 
      strategy combining sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor with limited single-agent 
      activity in AML, and cytarabine, a key component of AML chemotherapy. METHODS: 
      Using 10 human AML cell lines, we determined the effects of sorafenib (10 μM) on 
      antileukemic activity by measuring cell viability, proliferation, ERK1/2 
      signaling, and apoptosis. We also investigated the effects of sorafenib treatment 
      on the accumulation of cytarabine and phosphorylated metabolites in vitro. A 
      human equivalent dose of sorafenib in nontumor-bearing NOD-SCID-IL2Rγ(null) mice 
      was determined by pharmacokinetic studies using high performance liquid 
      chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection, and steady-state 
      concentrations were estimated by the fit of a one-compartment pharmacokinetic 
      model to concentration-time data. The antitumor activity of sorafenib alone (60 
      mg/kg) twice daily, cytarabine alone (6.25 mg/kg administered intraperitoneally), 
      or sorafenib once or twice daily plus cytarabine was evaluated in 
      NOD-SCID-IL2Rγ(null) mice bearing AML xenografts. RESULTS: Sorafenib at 10 μM 
      inhibited cell viability, proliferation and ERK1/2 signaling, and induced 
      apoptosis in all cell lines studied. Sorafenib also increased the cellular 
      accumulation of cytarabine and metabolites resulting in additive to synergistic 
      antileukemic activity. A dose of 60 mg/kg in mice produced a human equivalent 
      sorafenib steady-state plasma exposure of 10 μM. The more dose-intensive 
      twice-daily sorafenib plus cytarabine (n = 15) statistically significantly 
      prolonged median survival in an AML xenograft model compared with sorafenib once 
      daily plus cytarabine (n = 12), cytarabine alone (n = 26), or controls (n = 27) 
      (sorafenib twice daily plus cytarabine, median survival = 46 days; sorafenib once 
      daily plus cytarabine, median survival = 40 days; cytarabine alone, median 
      survival = 36 days; control, median survival = 19 days; P < .001 for combination 
      twice daily vs all other treatments listed). CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib in 
      combination with cytarabine resulted in strong anti-AML activity in vitro and in 
      vivo. These results warrant clinical evaluation of sorafenib with 
      cytarabine-based regimens in molecularly heterogeneous AML.

AB  - Pursuing on our efforts regarding development of novel multikinase inhibitors, 
      herein we report the design and synthesis of novel 2-indolinone-based ureides 
      6a-u and amides 10a-j. In this work we adopt a hybridization strategy between 
      type IIA PTK inhibitor (sorafenib) and type IIB PTK inhibitors (sunitinib and 
      nintedanib). This was implemented via linking the indolinone core, in both 
      sunitinib and nintedanib, which is well-fitted in the hinge region in the kinase 
      domain front cleft and the biaryl urea extension, in sorafenib, which is 
      accommodated in the gate area and the hydrophobic back pocket. Molecular docking 
      of the designed hybrid compounds in VEGFR-2 and FGFR-1 active sites revealed, as 
      planned, their ability to establish the binding interactions achieved by both 
      original type IIA and type IIB inhibitors. The designed compounds were evaluated 
      for their multikinase inhibitory activity towards VEGFR-2, PDGFR-b and FGFR-1 and 
      anti-proliferative activity towards HepG2, MCF-7, A549 and A498 cancer cell 
      lines. The ureido analogue 6u emerged as the most potent multikinase inhibitor in 
      the ureido series with VEGFR-2, FGFR-1 and PDGFR-b IC(50) of 0.18, 0.23 and 
      0.10 μM, respectively. Whereas, the amido congener 10j emerged as the most potent 
      multikinase inhibitor in the amide series with VEGFR-2, FGFR-1 and PDGFR-b IC(50) 
      of 0.28, 0.46 and 0.09 μM, respectively. While, indolinone 6u was the most potent 
      derivative towards HepG2 cells (IC(50) = 2.67 ± 0.14 μM), 6r stood out as the 
      most potent indolinone against A498 cells (IC(50) = 0.78 ± 0.02 μM). 
      Additionally, the target indolinones displayed non-significant cytotoxic impact 
      towards human normal melanocyte (HFB4). ADME prediction study of the designed 
      compounds showed that they are not only with promising multikinase inhibitory 
      activity but also with favorable pharmacokinetic and drug-likeness properties. 
      Compounds 6r and 10j are revealed to be the best compounds in terms of 
      multikinase activity and pharmacokinetics.

TI  - PG545, a dual heparanase and angiogenesis inhibitor, induces potent anti-tumour 
      and anti-metastatic efficacy in preclinical models.
PG  - 635-42
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2011.11 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: PG545 is a heparan sulfate (HS) mimetic that inhibits tumour 
      angiogenesis by sequestering angiogenic growth factors in the extracellular 
      matrix (ECM), thus limiting subsequent binding to receptors. Importantly, PG545 
      also inhibits heparanase, the only endoglycosidase which cleaves HS chains in the 
      ECM. The aim of the study was to assess PG545 in various solid tumour and 
      metastasis models. METHODS: The anti-angiogenic, anti-tumour and anti-metastatic 
      properties of PG545 were assessed using in vivo angiogenesis, solid tumour and 
      metastasis models. Pharmacokinetic (PK) data were also generated in 
      tumour-bearing mice to gain an understanding of optimal dosing schedules and 
      regimens. RESULTS: PG545 was shown to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo and induce 
      anti-tumour or anti-metastatic effects in murine models of breast, prostate, 
      liver, lung, colon, head and neck cancers and melanoma. Enhanced anti-tumour 
      activity was also noted when used in combination with sorafenib in a liver cancer 
      model. PK data revealed that the half-life of PG545 was relatively long, with 
      pharmacologically relevant concentrations of radiolabeled PG545 observed in liver 
      tumours. CONCLUSION: PG545 is a new anti-angiogenic clinical candidate for cancer 
      therapy. The anti-metastatic property of PG545, likely due to the inhibition of 
      heparanase, may prove to be a critical attribute as the compound enters phase I 
      clinical trials.

TI  - The drug-drug interaction of sorafenib mediated by P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4.
PG  - 651-658

AB  - 1. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential drug-drug interaction 
      of sorafenib mediated by P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). 
      2. In this research, a sensitive and reliable LC-MS/MS method was developed and 
      applied for the determination of sorafenib in rat plasma. The pharmacokinetic 
      profiles of orally administered sorafenib from rats with and without verapamil 
      pretreatment were investigated. 3. The results indicated that when the rats were 
      pretreated with verapamil, the C(max) of sorafenib increased from 55.73 ng/ml to 
      87.72 ng/ml (57.40%), and the AUC((0-)(t)()) increased by approximately 58.2% 
      when sorafenib was co-administered with verapamil. Additionally, the effects of 
      verapamil on the absorption of sorafenib were investigated using the Caco-2 cell 
      transwell model, and the effects of verapamil on the metabolic stability of 
      sorafenib were also studied using rat liver microsomes incubation systems. A 
      markedly higher transport of sorafenib across the Caco-2 cells was observed in 
      the basolateral-to-apical direction and was abrogated in the presence of the P-gp 
      inhibitor, verapamil. The results indicated that P-gp was involved in the 
      transport of sorafenib, and verapamil could increase its absorption in the Caco-2 
      cell model, and the metabolic stability of sorafenib was prolonged by the 
      pretreatment with verapamil. 4. In conclusion, the drug-drug interaction of 
      sorafenib might happen when sorafenib was co-administered with P-gp or CYP3A4 
      inhibitors.

AB  - Through rational drug design, we previously identified an indenoprazole 
      derivative, 
      2-(6-ethoxy-3-(3-ethoxyphenylamino)-1-methyl-1,4-dihydroindeno[1,2-c]pyrazol-7-yloxy)acetamide 
      (LL01), as a potent tubulin polymerization inhibitor targeting the tubulin 
      colchicine binding site. In this study, we further demonstrated that LL01 was not 
      a P-gp substrate. It potently inhibited the growth of a variety of tumor cells, 
      including those with multidrug resistance, with GI(50) values in the low nanomole 
      ranges. In vitro liver microsome stability assay, LL01 was modest stable in the 
      liver microsomes of human, mouse and rat, but was fast metabolized in dog. After 
      single oral administration of LL01 at a dose of 10 mg/kg in SD male rats, LL01 
      showed acceptable PK properties with a mean bioavailability of 41%. In human 
      HepG2 hepatoma xenograft, at the oral doses of 25 mg/kg/day and 12.5 mg/kg/day, 
      LL01 inhibited the tumor growth by 61.27%, and 43.74%, respectively, which is 
      much better than the positive drug sorafenib (29.45%; 30 mg/kg/day). Therefore, 
      LL01 might be a potential drug candidate for further investigation for 
      hepatocellular carcinoma therapy.

AB  - Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) are a novel and target-specific class of 
      anticancer drugs. One drawback of TKI therapy is cancer resistance to TKI. An 
      important TKI resistance mechanism is enhanced efflux of TKI by efflux 
      transporters, such as Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BCRP), in cancer cells. 
      5,7-Dimethoxyflavone (5,7-DMF) is a natural flavonoid which was recently reported 
      to be a potent BCRP inhibitor. In the current study, the effect of 5,7-DMF on the 
      disposition of sorafenib, a TKI which is a good substrate of BCRP, was 
      investigated both in vitro in efflux transporter expressing cells and in vivo in 
      mice. 5,7-DMF significantly inhibited Bcrp1-mediated sorafenib efflux in a 
      concentration dependent manner in MDCK/Bcrp1 cells, with EC(50) value of 8.78 μM. 
      The pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of sorafenib (10 mg/kg) with and 
      without co-administration of 75 mg/kg 5,7-DMF were determined. With 5,7-DMF, the 
      AUC of sorafenib in plasma was 47,400 ± 4790 ng·h/mL, which was significantly 
      higher than 27,300 ± 2650 ng·h/mL in sorafenib alone group. In addition, compared 
      to sorafenib alone group, great increase in sorafenib AUC was observed in most 
      tissues collected when sorafenib was given with 5,7-DMF. Our results indicated 
      that 5,7-DMF may represent a novel and very promising chemosensitizing agent for 
      BCRP-mediated anticancer drug resistance due to its low toxicity and potent BCRP 
      inhibition.

AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib is recommended for therapy of advanced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma. Preclinical data indicate a relation between 
      dose and antitumor efficacy. In clinical trials, adverse events improve after 
      dose reduction suggesting a dose-dependent toxicity. Given dose has a direct 
      impact on the drug serum concentration, but the latter also can be influenced by 
      multiple factors, including interaction and metabolisation. To enable the 
      investigation of concentration-related effects, an easy and sensitive assay for 
      sorafenib drug monitoring is essential. METHODS: A high-performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC) analysis involving an extraction with diethyl ether 
      followed by separation on a Pinnacle™ DB C18 column and quantitation by UV 
      absorbance at 260 nm was established. Sorafenib concentrations in samples of 
      serum and peritoneal fluid have been determined. RESULTS: The assay was validated 
      for serum samples and is linear over the concentration range of 100-5,000 ng/ml 
      with a determination coefficient of >0.999. The limit of detection is 0.25 ng/ml. 
      The intra- and inter-day coefficients of variation were below 3.03%. Sorafenib 
      recovery in spiked probes of peritoneal fluid was above 85%. Sorafenib 
      concentrations in 44 serum samples and 14 probes of peritoneal fluid have been 
      determined with a mean of 3,328 and 1,380 ng/ml, respectively (standard deviation 
      2,267 and 659 ng/ml). CONCLUSIONS: A sensitive and selective HPLC method for the 
      determination of sorafenib in human serum was developed and also verified for 
      peritoneal fluid. This method provides a useful tool for pharmacokinetic 
      investigations as well as for therapeutic drug monitoring of sorafenib.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate feasibility, safety, and effect of transarterial 
      chemoembolization using sorafenib on degree of tumor necrosis in a rabbit VX2 
      liver tumor model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: New Zealand White rabbits (n = 20) with 
      a VX2 tumor were divided into two groups; one group was treated with hepatic 
      arterial administration of 0.5 mL ethiodized oil alone (Lipiodol; Guerbet, 
      Aulnay-sous-Bois, France) (transarterial embolization with Lipiodol [TAE-L] 
      group), and one group was treated with 0.5 mL ethiodized oil plus 10 mg sorafenib 
      (transarterial embolization with sorafenib [TAE-S] group). Liquid chromatography 
      tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure sorafenib concentration in 
      peripheral blood and tissue. Hepatic enzymes, vascular endothelial growth factor 
      (VEGF), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) were measured at 0, 24, and 72 
      hours after treatment. Histopathologic examination was performed to evaluate 
      extent of tumor necrosis and normal parenchymal damage. RESULTS: Serum sorafenib 
      concentration peaked at 2 hours after treatment. The mean tissue concentration 
      was 406.8 times greater than the serum concentration. Aspartate aminotransferase 
      and alanine aminotransferase levels were significantly elevated in the TAE-S 
      group at 24 hours after treatment. Serum VEGF and HIF-1α concentrations were not 
      significantly different between the TAE-L and TAE-S groups. Hepatic parenchymal 
      damage was more severe in the TAE-S group. Mean fraction of tumor necrosis after 
      treatment was significantly greater in the TAE-S group. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Transarterial chemoembolization using sorafenib resulted in a high intrahepatic 
      concentration of sorafenib. The degree of tumor necrosis was significantly 
      greater in the TAE-S group compared with the TAE-L group, but more severe 
      toxicity of normal liver tissue also occurred.

TI  - CEP-32496: a novel orally active BRAF(V600E) inhibitor with selective cellular 
      and in vivo antitumor activity.
PG  - 930-41
LID - 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-11-0645 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in the BRAF gene have been identified in approximately 7% of cancers, 
      including 60% to 70% of melanomas, 29% to 83% of papillary thyroid carcinomas, 4% 
      to 16% colorectal cancers, and a lesser extent in serous ovarian and non-small 
      cell lung cancers. The V600E mutation is found in the vast majority of cases and 
      is an activating mutation, conferring transforming and immortalization potential 
      to cells. CEP-32496 is a potent BRAF inhibitor in an in vitro binding assay for 
      mutated BRAF(V600E) (K(d) BRAF(V600E) = 14 nmol/L) and in a mitogen-activated 
      protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated (ER) kinase (MEK) phosphorylation 
      (pMEK) inhibition assay in human melanoma (A375) and colorectal cancer (Colo-205) 
      cell lines (IC(50) = 78 and 60 nmol/L). In vitro, CEP-32496 has multikinase 
      binding activity at other cancer targets of interest; however, it exhibits 
      selective cellular cytotoxicity for BRAF(V600E) versus wild-type cells. CEP-32496 
      is orally bioavailable in multiple preclinical species (>95% in rats, dogs, and 
      monkeys) and has single oral dose pharmacodynamic inhibition (10-55 mg/kg) of 
      both pMEK and pERK in BRAF(V600E) colon carcinoma xenografts in nude mice. 
      Sustained tumor stasis and regressions are observed with oral administration 
      (30-100 mg/kg twice daily) against BRAF(V600E) melanoma and colon carcinoma 
      xenografts, with no adverse effects. Little or no epithelial hyperplasia was 
      observed in rodents and primates with prolonged oral administration and sustained 
      exposure. CEP-32496 benchmarks favorably with respect to other kinase inhibitors, 
      including RAF-265 (phase I), sorafenib, (approved), and vemurafenib 
      (PLX4032/RG7204, approved). CEP-32496 represents a novel and pharmacologically 
      active BRAF inhibitor with a favorable side effect profile currently in clinical 
      development.

      Combination with Paclitaxel in Patients with Advanced Refractory Solid Tumors.
PG  - 2155-2162
LID - 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-20-0277 [doi]
AB  - VEGF blockade does not uniformly result in clinical benefit. We evaluated safety, 
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), recommended phase II dose (RP2D), antitumor 
      efficacy, and exploratory biomarkers including pharmacogenomics and 
      pharmacokinetics with sorafenib, bevacizumab, and paclitaxel in patients with 
      refractory cancers. The study had a "3 + 3" design, using paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) 
      every week for 3 weeks, in every 4 week cycles, bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 2 
      weeks, and sorafenib 200 or 400 mg twice a day, 5 or 7 days/week (5/7, 7/7). The 
      MTD cohort was expanded. Twenty-seven patients enrolled in 3 cohorts: sorafenib 
      200 mg twice a day 5/7, 200 mg twice a day 7/7, and 400 mg twice a day 5/7. DLTs 
      were grade 3 neutropenia >7 days (cohort 1, 1), grade 3 hypertension (cohort 2, 
      1), grade 3 hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR; cohort 3, 2). MTD was sorafenib 200 mg 
      twice a day 7/7. Six DLTs occurred in cohort 2 expansion: grade 3 HFSR (2), grade 
      2 HFSR with sorafenib delay >7 days (2), grade 4 cerebrovascular accident (1), 
      grade 3 neutropenia >7 days (1). RP2D was sorafenib 200 mg twice a day 5/7. Most 
      patients (62%) dose reduced sorafenib to 200 mg daily 5/7 after a median 3 
      (range, 2-17) cycles. Response rates were 48% overall (27) and 64% for ovarian 
      cancers (14). VEGF-A-1154AA and -7TT recessive homozygous genotypes conferred 
      worse overall survival versus alternative genotypes (7 vs. 22 months). 
      Intermittent, low-dose sorafenib (200 mg twice a day 5/7) combined with 
      bevacizumab and paclitaxel was tolerable and had high antitumor efficacy in 
      patients with refractory cancer (NCT00572078).

TI  - A polymeric nanoformulation improves the bioavailability and efficacy of 
      sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma therapy.
PG  - 2508-2518
LID - 10.1039/d0bm01881c [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer-related death 
      worldwide. Sorafenib (sfb) is widely used in clinics for advanced HCC therapy. 
      However, the therapeutic efficacy of sfb is suboptimal due to its poor water 
      solubility, low bioavailability, and side effects. Here, we employed a clinically 
      safe polymer poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(lactic acid) (PEG-b-PLA) to prepare a 
      nanoparticle (NP)-based sfb formulation (NP-sfb) and tested its antitumor effect 
      in multiple HCC models. NP-sfb could achieve effective drug loading and remain 
      stable under physiological conditions. NP-sfb could be taken up by HepG2, 
      Hepa1-6, and H22 cells and could efficiently inhibit cell proliferation and/or 
      promote cell apoptosis. In vivo studies indicated that NP-sfb showed 
      significantly improved therapeutic efficacy compared with free-sfb at the same 
      dose or even higher doses. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that NP-sfb not only 
      inhibited tumor proliferation and angiogenesis but also stimulated the tumor 
      microenvironment by reducing the infiltration of immunosuppressive myeloid cells 
      and increasing the ratio of cytotoxic T cells. This study demonstrates that the 
      NP-based formulation is a promising strategy to improve the clinical application 
      of sfb.

TI  - Interaction of the multikinase inhibitors sorafenib and sunitinib with solute 
      carriers and ATP-binding cassette transporters.
PG  - 6062-9
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-0048 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare side-by-side the uptake of sorafenib and sunitinib in vitro 
      by human uptake solute carriers of the SLC22A and SLCO families, the transport by 
      and inhibition of efflux ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, and the role of 
      ABCB1 in the plasma pharmacokinetics and brain penetration of these agents. 
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Uptake of [(3)H]sorafenib or [(3)H]sunitinib was assessed in 
      Xenopus laevis oocytes or mammalian cells transfected with cDNAs coding for human 
      OATP1A2, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OAT2, OAT3, OCTN1, or OCTN2. Efflux and 
      inhibition experiments were conducted in cells transfected with human ABCB1, 
      ABCG2, ABCC2, or ABCC4. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies were done in knockout 
      mice lacking Abcb1-type transporters. RESULTS: Intracellular uptake was not 
      appreciably affected by any of the studied solute carriers and was minute 
      relative to the respective prototypical substrates. Sorafenib and sunitinib 
      showed concentration-dependent (1 and 10 micromol/L), low to moderate affinity 
      for ABCB1 but were not affected by the other ABC transporters. Both agents 
      inhibited all tested ABC transporters. The absence of Abcb1 had no affect on 
      plasma pharmacokinetics, but brain penetration was moderately increased by 1.9- 
      and 2.9-fold for sorafenib and sunitinib, respectively, in knockout animals 
      versus controls. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, sorafenib 
      and sunitinib do not appear to rely on active transport to enter the cell nor are 
      they high-affinity substrates for ABC efflux transporters. Based on these 
      characteristics, these two drugs may be less susceptible to transporter-mediated 
      alterations in systemic exposure and transporter-related resistance mechanisms.

TI  - Sorafenib administered using a high-dose, pulsatile regimen in patients with 
      advanced solid malignancies: a phase I exposure escalation study.
PG  - 931-940
LID - 10.1007/s00280-020-04065-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: (Pre)clinical evidence is accumulating that intermittent exposure to 
      increased doses of protein kinase inhibitors may improve their treatment benefit. 
      In this phase I trial, the safety of high-dose, pulsatile sorafenib was studied. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: High-dose sorafenib was administered once weekly in 
      exposure escalation cohorts according to a 3 + 3 design. Drug monitoring was 
      performed in weeks 1-3 and doses were adjusted to achieve a predefined target 
      plasma area under the curve (AUC)(0-12 h). The effect of low gastric pH on 
      improving sorafenib exposure was investigated by intake of the acidic beverage 
      cola. RESULTS: Seventeen patients with advanced malignancies without standard 
      treatment options were included. Once weekly, high-dose sorafenib exposure was 
      escalated up to a target AUC(0-12 h) of 125-150 mg/L/h, achieving a twofold 
      higher C(max) compared to standard continuous dosing. Dose-limiting toxicity was 
      observed in three patients: grade 3 duodenal perforation (2800 mg sorafenib), 
      grade 5 multiorgan failure (2800 mg sorafenib) and grade 5 biliary tract 
      perforation (3600 mg sorafenib). The mean difference between observed and target 
      AUC(0-12 h) was 45% (SD ± 56%) in week 1 using a fixed starting dose of sorafenib 
      compared to 2% (SD ± 32%) in week 3 as a result of drug monitoring (P = 0.06). 
      Dissolving sorafenib in cola, instead of water, did not improve sorafenib 
      exposure. Clinical benefit with stable disease as the best response was observed 
      in two patients. CONCLUSION: Treatment with high-dose, once weekly sorafenib 
      administration resulted in dose-limiting toxicity precluding dose escalation 
      above the exposure cohort of 125-150 mg/L/h. Drug monitoring was a successful 
      strategy to pursue a target exposure.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo evaluation of redox-responsive sorafenib carrier 
      nanomicelles synthesized from poly (acryic acid) -cystamine 
      hydrochloride-D-α-tocopherol succinate.
PG  - 1729-1747
AB  - In this study, a controlled drug release system based on redox-responsive 
      nanomicelles for drug delivery was described. The system was constructed by 
      linking poly (acryic acid) (PAA) with D-α-tocopherol succinate (VES) via a 
      disulfide bond linker (ss). This amphiphilic polymer (PAAssVES) was synthesized 
      by coupling reaction and its chemical structure was confirmed by FT-IR and 
      (1)HNMR analyses. PAAssVES was found to self-assemble into nanomicelles with 
      diameter of about 130 nm, and a critical micelle concentration of about 
      6.3 μg/mL. The Sorafenib-loaded nanomicelles (SFN-NM) were almost spherical as 
      observed by transmission electron microscopy. Differential scanning calorimetry 
      analysis showed that Sorafenib (SFN) was entrapped in the micelles in an 
      amorphous or molecular state. The safety of SFN-NM was confirmed by hemolysis 
      study. The release of SFN from the nanomicelles was dependent on the 
      concentration of glutathione (GSH), with 85% of the drug being released under the 
      maximum concentration (40 mM) of GSH used. SFN-NM exhibited stronger cytotoxicity 
      than free SFN against BGC-823 cells under the same SFN concentration. 
      Furthermore, pharmacokinetics study showed that the bioavailability of SFN in rat 
      obtained by injecting the animal with SFN-NM was about 2.8-fold the 
      bioavailability of SFN obtained by injecting the animal with free SFN. Thus, the 
      redox-responsive SFN delivery system described in the current study could be 
      considered as a carrier for delivering SFN.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Angiogenesis is critical for tumour growth and metastasis. Dual 
      inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factors and platelet-derived growth 
      factor receptors suppresses angiogenesis. This expansion cohort of a phase I 
      study targeted angiogenesis with sorafenib, bevacizumab and low-dose 
      cyclophosphamide in children and young adults with recurrent solid tumours. 
      METHODS: An expansion cohort including patients with refractory or recurrent 
      solid tumours was enrolled and received bevacizumab (15 mg/kg IV, day 1), 
      sorafenib (90 mg/m(2) po twice daily, days 1-21) and low-dose cyclophosphamide 
      (50 mg/m(2) po daily, days 1-21). Each course was 21 days. Toxicities were 
      assessed using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v3.0, and 
      responses were evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
      criteria. Serial bevacizumab pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were performed during 
      course 1. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients (15 males; median age 14.5 yrs; range 
      1-22 yr) received a median of 6 courses (range 1-18). Twelve patients had a bone 
      or soft tissue sarcoma. The most common grade III/IV non-haematologic toxicities 
      were hypertension (N = 4), hand/foot rash (N = 3) and elevated lipase (N = 3). 
      The most common grade III/IV haematologic toxicities were neutropenia (N = 7) and 
      lymphopenia (N = 17). Three patients (2 synovial sarcoma, 1 rhabdoid tumour) 
      achieved a partial response and 18 had stable disease. The progression-free 
      survival at 3 and 6 months were 78.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 60.6-95.6%) 
      and 54% (95% CI 30.2-78.2%), respectively. Bevacizumab PKs in 15 patients was 
      similar to published adult PK results. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous bevacizumab 
      combined with oral sorafenib and low-dose cyclophosphamide was tolerated and 
      demonstrated promising activity in a subset of childhood solid tumours.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the safety and feasibility of the targeted delivery of the 
      antiangiogenic drug sorafenib to the liver using transarterial chemoembolization 
      methodology as a novel approach to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) therapy. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven healthy New Zealand white rabbits were used in the 
      study. After placement of a catheter in the common hepatic artery, six rabbits 
      were treated with chemoembolization of sorafenib in iodized oil (Lipiodol) 
      (sorafenib dose 0.1 mg/kg), and one rabbit received Lipiodol only. Liquid 
      chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure the concentration of 
      sorafenib in the peripheral blood and liver tissue 24 hours and 72 hours after 
      treatment. Histochemical staining of the liver sections and biochemical 
      measurements were performed. RESULTS: The administration of sorafenib in Lipiodol 
      emulsions by transarterial chemoembolization resulted in sorafenib concentrations 
      of 794 ng/g ± 240 and 64 ng/g ± 15 in the liver tissue 24 hours and 72 hours 
      after treatment. The average liver-to-serum ratios 24 hours and 72 hours after 
      treatment were approximately 14 and 22. The histochemical staining of the liver 
      tissue sections and aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, 
      γ-glutamyltransferase and total bilirubin concentrations indicated no significant 
      liver damage. CONCLUSIONS: Transarterial chemoembolization with sorafenib in 
      Lipiodol is an effective methodology for the localized delivery of this drug to 
      the liver and has possible practical implications in therapeutic interventions 
      for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.

TI  - Phase I and Preliminary Phase II Study of TRC105 in Combination with Sorafenib in 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
PG  - 4633-4641
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-16-3171 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Endoglin (CD105) is an endothelial cell membrane receptor highly 
      expressed on proliferating tumor vasculature, including that of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC), and is associated with poor prognosis. Endoglin is essential for 
      angiogenesis, and its expression is induced by hypoxia and VEGF pathway 
      inhibition. TRC105 is a chimeric IgG1 CD105 mAb that inhibits angiogenesis and 
      causes antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and apoptosis of proliferating 
      endothelium.Experimental Design: Patients with HCC (Child-Pugh A/B7), ECOG 0/1, 
      were enrolled in a phase I study of TRC105 at 3, 6, 10, and 15 mg/kg every 2 
      weeks given with sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. Correlative biomarkers included 
      DCE-MRI and plasma levels of angiogenic factors, including soluble endoglin. 
      Pharmacokinetics were assessed in serum.Results: Twenty-six patients were 
      enrolled, of whom 25 received treatment, 15 with cirrhosis. Hep B/C: 3/15; M:F 
      19:6; mean age of 60 (range, 18-76); 1 DLT (grade 3 AST) occurred at 10 mg/kg. 
      The most frequent toxicity was low-grade epistaxis, a known toxicity of TRC105. 
      One patient experienced an infusion reaction and was replaced. One patient with 
      coronary stenosis developed a fatal myocardial infarction, and one patient 
      developed G3 cerebral tumor hemorrhage. MTD was not established and DL4 (15 
      mg/kg) was expanded. The overall response rate in 24 evaluable patients at all 4 
      dose levels was 21% [95% confidence interval (CI), 7.1-42.2], and 25% (95% CI, 
      8.7-49.1) in patients with measureable disease. Four patients had confirmed 
      stable disease, one of whom was treated for 22 months. Median progression-free 
      survival (PFS) for 24 patients evaluable for PFS was 3.8 months (95% CI, 3.2-5.6 
      months); median overall survival was 15.5 months (95% CI, 8.5-26.3 
      months).Conclusions: TRC105 combined with sorafenib was well tolerated at the 
      recommended single agent doses of both drugs. Encouraging evidence of activity to 
      date (PR rate 25%) was observed, and the study is now continuing to recruit in 
      the phase II stage as a multicenter study to confirm activity of the combination.

LID - 10.2217/fon-2016-0357 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This novel multiparameter Phase I study aimed to optimize doses/dosing 
      schedules of everolimus and sorafenib drug combination, based on 
      modeling/simulation (NCT01932177). PATIENTS & METHODS: About 26 patients with 
      solid tumors were treated in four different dosing schedules. Everolimus once 
      daily + sorafenib twice daily were given continuously in arms A and B, and 
      intermittently in arms C (alternating every other week) and D (everolimus 
      continuous and sorafenib 3 days on/4 days off). RESULTS: Continuous schedules 
      exhibited higher toxicity risks than intermittent schedules (64.1 vs 35.9%; p < 
      0.0001), and trends for lower disease control rates (80 vs 100%). No significant 
      pharmacokinetic interaction was identified. CONCLUSION: Feasibility of EVESOR 
      trial is demonstrated. Intermittent schedules might provide better tolerance and 
      efficacy than continuous schedules.

TI  - Tivozanib for the treatment of metastatic renal cancer.
PG  - 649-60
LID - 10.1586/era.13.40 [doi]
AB  - Tyrosine kinase inhibitors have revolutionized the treatment of metastatic renal 
      cell carcinoma (RCC). Drugs such as sorafenib, sunitinib and pazopanib act on the 
      VEGF receptor pathway, but they can also inhibit other kinases, resulting in 
      off-target toxicities. Tivozanib was developed due to its potency and selectivity 
      against VEGF receptors 1-3. It has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile after oral 
      administration and a long plasma half-life. In the Phase III TIVO-1 trial, it 
      demonstrated a higher response rate and longer progression-free survival than 
      sorafenib with a better side-effect profile. It is currently awaiting approval to 
      be used in the first-line treatment of metastatic RCC. An early-phase trial has 
      also shown its tolerability at full dose when given with the mTOR inhibitor 
      temsirolimus, suggesting its potential in combination treatment. This article 
      examines tivozanib from its laboratory to clinical development, as well as its 
      relevance and future role in the treatment of RCC in the era of the tyrosine 
      kinase inhibitors.

TI  - Combination targeted therapy with sorafenib and bevacizumab results in enhanced 
      toxicity and antitumor activity.
PG  - 3709-14
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2007.10.8332 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sorafenib inhibits Raf kinase and vascular endothelial growth factor 
      (VEGF) receptor. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody targeted against VEGF. We 
      hypothesized that the complementary inhibition of VEGF signaling would have 
      synergistic therapeutic effects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients had advanced 
      solid tumors, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1, 
      and good end-organ function. A phase I dose-escalation trial of sorafenib and 
      bevacizumab was initiated at below-recommended single-agent doses because of 
      possible overlapping toxicity: sorafenib 200 mg orally twice daily and 
      bevacizumab intravenously at 5 mg/kg (dose level [DL] 1) or 10 mg/kg (DL2) every 
      2 weeks. Additional patients were enrolled at the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). 
      RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients were treated. DL1 was the MTD and administered in 
      cohort 2 (N = 27). Dose-limiting toxicity in DL2 was grade 3 proteinuria and 
      thrombocytopenia. Adverse events included hypertension, hand-foot syndrome, 
      diarrhea, transaminitis, and fatigue. Partial responses (PRs) were seen in six 
      (43%) of 13 patients with ovarian cancer (response duration range, 4 to 22+ 
      months) and one of three patients with renal cell cancer (response duration, 14 
      months). PR or disease stabilization >or= 4 months (median, 6 months; range, 4 to 
      22+ months) was seen in 22 (59%) of 37 assessable patients. The majority (74%) 
      required sorafenib dose reduction to 200 mg/d at a median of four cycles (range, 
      one to 12 cycles). CONCLUSION: Combination therapy with sorafenib and bevacizumab 
      has promising clinical activity, especially in patients with ovarian cancer. The 
      rapidity and frequency of sorafenib dose reductions indicates that sorafenib at 
      200 mg twice daily with bevacizumab 5 mg/kg every 2 weeks may not be tolerable 
      long term, and alternate sorafenib dosing schedules should be explored.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Factors Contribute to Synergism between 
      Let-7c-5p and 5-Fluorouracil in Inhibiting Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell 
      Viability.
PG  - 1257-1263
LID - 10.1124/dmd.120.000207 [doi]
AB  - Pharmacological interventions for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are hindered by 
      complex factors, and rational combination therapy may be developed to improve 
      therapeutic outcomes. Very recently, we have identified a bioengineered microRNA 
      let-7c-5p (or let-7c) agent as an effective inhibitor against HCC in vitro and in 
      vivo. In this study, we sought to identify small-molecule drugs that may 
      synergistically act with let-7c against HCC. Interestingly, we found that let-7c 
      exhibited a strong synergism with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in the inhibition of HCC 
      cell viability as manifested by average combination indices of 0.3 and 0.5 in 
      Hep3B and Huh7 cells, respectively. By contrast, coadministration of let-7c with 
      doxorubicin or sorafenib inhibited HCC cell viability with, rather surprisingly, 
      no or minimal synergy. Further studies showed that protein levels of multidrug 
      resistance-associated protein (MRP) ATP-binding cassette subfamily C member 5 
      (MRP5/ABCC5), a 5-FU efflux transporter, were reduced around 50% by let-7c in HCC 
      cells. This led to a greater degree of intracellular accumulation of 5-FU in Huh7 
      cells as well as the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate, an 
      endogenous substrate of MRP5. Since 5-FU is an irreversible inhibitor of 
      thymidylate synthetase (TS), we investigated the interactions of let-7c with 5-FU 
      at pharmacodynamic level. Interestingly, our data revealed that let-7c 
      significantly reduced TS protein levels in Huh7 cells, which was associated with 
      the suppression of upstream transcriptional factors as well as other regulatory 
      factors. Collectively, these results indicate that let-7c interacts with 5-FU at 
      both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic levels, and these findings shall offer 
      insight into molecular mechanisms of synergistic drug combinations. SIGNIFICANCE 
      STATEMENT: Combination therapy is a common strategy that generally involves 
      pharmacodynamic interactions. After identifying a strong synergism between 
      let-7c-5p and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) against hepatocellular carcinoma cell 
      viability, we reveal the involvement of both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
      mechanisms. In particular, let-7c enhances 5-FU exposure (via suppressing 
      ABCC5/MRP5 expression) and cotargets thymidylate synthase with 5-FU (let-7c 
      reduces protein expression, whereas 5-FU irreversibly inactivates enzyme). These 
      findings provide insight into developing rational combination therapies based on 
      pharmacological mechanisms.

PG  - 1562-6
LID - 10.1002/pbc.25548 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sorafenib is an oral small molecule inhibitor of multiple kinases 
      controlling tumor growth and angiogenesis. The purpose of the phase 2 study was 
      to determine the response rate of sorafenib and gain further information on the 
      associated toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of sorafenib in 
      children and young adults with relapsed or refractory tumors including 
      rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms tumor, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and papillary 
      thyroid carcinoma (PTC). PROCEDURE: Sorafenib, 200 mg/m(2) /dose, was 
      administered every 12 hr continuously for 28 day cycles using a two-stage design 
      in two primary strata (rhabdomyosarcoma and Wilms tumor) and two secondary strata 
      (HCC and PTC). Correlative studies in consenting patients included determination 
      of sorafenib steady state trough concentrations and assessments of VEGF and 
      sVEGFR2. RESULTS: Twenty patients (median age of 11 years; range, 5-21) enrolled. 
      No objective responses (RECIST) were observed in the 10 evaluable patients 
      enrolled in each of the two primary disease strata of rhabdomyosarcoma and Wilms 
      tumor. No patients with HCC or PTC were enrolled. Sorafenib was not associated 
      with an excessive rate of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). The mean ± SD steady 
      state concentration during cycle 1 day 15 was 6.5 ± 3.9 μg/ml (n = 10). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib was well tolerated in children at 200 mg/m(2) /dose twice 
      daily on a continuous regimen with toxicity profile and steady state drug 
      concentrations similar to those previously reported. Single agent sorafenib was 
      inactive in children with recurrent or refractory rhabdomyosarcoma or Wilms 
      tumor.

TI  - Development and validation of an HPLC-UV method for sorafenib quantification in 
      human plasma and application to patients with cancer in routine clinical 
      practice.
PG  - 317-25

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several factors such as low therapeutic index, large interindividual 
      variability in systemic exposure, and the relationships between exposure and 
      toxicity for sorafenib could justify its therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). To 
      support TDM, a selective and precise high-performance liquid chromatography with 
      ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) method was developed and validated for the 
      determination of sorafenib in human plasma. METHODS: After protein precipitation 
      with acetonitrile, sorafenib and lapatinib (internal standard) were separated 
      using isocratic elution on a Kromasil C18 column using a mobile phase of 
      acetonitrile and 20 mmol/L ammonium acetate in a proportion 53:47 (vol/vol) 
      pumped at a constant flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. Quantification was performed at 260 
      nm. Validation experiments were carried out after the guidelines for 
      Bioanalytical Method Validation published by the Food and Drug Administration and 
      the European Medicines Agency. RESULTS: Calibration curves were linear over the 
      range 0.1-20 mcg/mL. Inter- and intra-day coefficients of variation were <3%. The 
      limit of detection and the lower limit of quantification were 0.06 and 0.1 
      mcg/mL, respectively. Recoveries of sorafenib from plasma were >99% in all cases. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This method was successfully applied to the determination of the 
      drug in the plasma of 2 patients with cancer receiving sorafenib 200 and 400 mg 
      orally twice daily, respectively, and could be useful for TDM of sorafenib in 
      routine clinical practice.

TI  - Phase I/II study of sorafenib in combination with erlotinib for recurrent 
      glioblastoma as part of a 3-arm sequential accrual clinical trial: NABTC 05-02.
PG  - vdaa124
LID - 10.1093/noajnl/vdaa124 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptors 
      (EGFRs) and their downstream signaling pathways such as the 
      Ras-Raf-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway play important roles in 
      glioblastoma (GBM). This study investigated the safety, pharmacokinetics, and 
      efficacy of sorafenib (Ras/Raf/MAPK inhibitor) in combination with erlotinib 
      (EGFR inhibitor) for treatment of recurrent GBMs. METHODS: Patients with 
      recurrent GBM were eligible. A novel sequential accrual trial design was used, 
      where patients were sequentially accrued into separate treatment arms in phase I 
      and phase II investigations to optimize recruitment efficiency. In phase I, a 
      standard 3 + 3 format was used to identify dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), 
      determine maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and investigate pharmacokinetics. Phase 
      II followed a 2-stage design with the primary endpoint being 6-month 
      progression-free survival (PFS6). RESULTS: Sixteen patients were recruited for 
      phase I, and the MTD was determined to be sorafenib 200 mg twice daily and 
      erlotinib 100 mg once daily. DLTs include Grade 3 hypertension, Grade 3 elevated 
      liver transaminases, and Grade 4 elevated lipase. While erlotinib did not affect 
      sorafenib levels, sorafenib reduced erlotinib levels. In phase II, 3 of 19 stage 
      1 participants were progression free at 6 months. This did not meet the 
      predetermined efficacy endpoint, and the trial was terminated. CONCLUSION: This 
      study identified the MTD and DLTs for sorafenib and erlotinib combination therapy 
      for recurrent GBMs; however, efficacy data did not meet the primary endpoint. 
      This study also demonstrates the feasibility of a novel sequential accrual 
      clinical trial design that optimizes patient recruitment for multiarm studies, 
      which is particularly effective for multicenter clinical trials.

TI  - Synergistic interactions between sorafenib and everolimus in pancreatic cancer 
      xenografts in mice.
PG  - 1231-40
LID - 10.1007/s00280-013-2117-x [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Molecular targeting of cellular signaling pathways is a promising 
      approach in cancer therapy, but often fails to achieve sustained benefit because 
      of the activation of collateral cancer cell survival and proliferation pathways. 
      We tested the hypothesis that a combination of targeted agents that inhibit 
      compensatory pathways would be more effective than single agents in controlling 
      pancreatic cancer cell growth. We investigated whether everolimus, an mTOR 
      inhibitor, and sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, would together inhibit growth 
      of low-passage, patient-derived pancreatic cancer xenografts in mice more 
      efficaciously than either agent alone. METHODS: Tumor volume progression was 
      measured following treatment with both drugs as single agents, in combination, 
      and at multiple doses. Pharmacokinetics in tumors and other tissues was also 
      assessed. Pharmacodynamic interactions were evaluated quantitatively. RESULTS: A 
      5-week regimen of daily oral doses of 10 mg/kg sorafenib and 0.5 mg/kg 
      everolimus, alone and in combination, did not achieve significant tumor growth 
      inhibition. Higher doses (20 mg/kg of sorafenib and 1 mg/kg of everolimus) 
      inhibited tumor growth significantly when given alone and caused complete 
      inhibition of growth when given in combination. Tumor volume progression was 
      described by a linear growth model, and drug effects were described by Hill-type 
      inhibition. Using population modeling approaches, dual-interaction parameter 
      estimates indicated a highly synergistic pharmacodynamic interaction between the 
      two drugs. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that combinations of mTOR and 
      multi-kinase inhibitors may offer greater efficacy in pancreatic cancer than 
      either drug alone. Drug effects upon tumor stromal elements may contribute to the 
      enhanced anti-tumor efficacy.

PG  - 43458-43469
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.16465 [doi]
AB  - This single-center, observational study analyzed the association between plasma 
      concentration of sorafenib and its safety and efficacy in Chinese patients with 
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Adult patients with RCC (n = 94), treated 
      with sorafenib were enrolled between January 2014 and January 2015. Sorafenib 
      plasma concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
      spectrometry. Safety and efficacy variables were evaluated using National Cancer 
      Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events and Response Evaluation 
      Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria. Association of plasma concentration with 
      safety and efficacy was analyzed. The steady state plasma concentration of 
      sorafenib after 2 weeks of treatment ranged from 881 to 12,526 ng/mL. Major 
      adverse reactions (ADRs) included diarrhea (76.5%), hand-foot syndrome (HFS; 
      68.99%) and fatigue (55.32%). Significant association was reported between plasma 
      concentration and all the ADRs except rash. At 6 weeks, complete response (CR), 
      partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and progressive disease (PD) was 
      reported in 3.1%, 13.82%, 52.2% and 13.82% patients, respectively. Objective 
      response and disease control rates were 17.02% and 69.14%. Plasma concentration 
      of sorafenib was >10,000 ng/mL in patients with severe ADRs, which decreased with 
      reduction in dose or discontinuation of treatment. After 21.2 weeks follow-up, 
      median progression free survival was 12.3 months. CR, PR, SD and PD were reported 
      in 1%, 46%, 33% and 19% patients. In conclusion, plasma concentration of 
      sorafenib was associated with its safety and efficacy in Chinese patients with 
      mRCC.

TI  - Enhanced antitumour effect for hepatocellular carcinoma in the advanced stage 
      using a cyclodextrin-sorafenib-chaperoned inclusion complex.
PG  - 4758-4768
LID - 10.1039/c9bm01190k [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a hypervascular tumour characterized by 
      tumour-driven neovascularization. The degrees of blood oxygen saturation (DBOS), 
      microvessel density (MVD) and tumour size (TS) are indicators in identifying the 
      development stage of HCC. Herein, we proposed an HCC staging model using HepG2 
      tumour-bearing mice based on DBOS, MVD and TS. According to the patterns of these 
      three criteria, HCC was classified into four stages: early, intermediate, 
      advanced and end stages. The advanced stage was characterized by MVD of 50-90 
      (number per mm(2)), DBOS of 12-16% and TS of 250-600 mm(3), which poses a 
      critical challenge in HCC therapy. In order to efficiently control and treat HCC 
      in the advanced stage, we developed a cyclodextrin (CD)-based chaperoned 
      inclusion complex using Sorafenib (Sor), β-CD and γ-CD (SCD) via the 
      co-crystallization method. The structural study manifested that CDs could 
      encapsulate Sor with the hydrophobic cavities at a 1 : 1 stoichiometry ratio. The 
      crystallographic analysis indicated that Sor-β-CD presented a diagonal stacking 
      pattern, while Sor-γ-CD possessed a channel-type structure. The resultant 
      chaperoned inclusion complexes significantly improved the solubility, dissolution 
      rate and drug release of Sor, leading to superior pharmacokinetics, 
      biodistribution and biosafety through oral administration. The antitumour effect 
      was then evaluated on a mouse model with advanced HCC through oral administration 
      and intratumour injection. The treatment involving the oral administration of 
      SCDs showed a promising therapeutic effect on advanced HCC, which efficiently 
      blocked angiogenesis and inhibited tumour progression. For the treatments using 
      intratumour injections, only Sor-γ-CD exhibited a satisfactory anti-tumour effect 
      with reduction in TS, MVD and DBOS. The enhanced therapeutic performance of 
      Sor-γ-CD was attributed to its channel-type structure, which had an impact on the 
      dissociation and release of the drug. Thus, Sor-γ-CD can be used as a potential 
      pro-drug for clinical medicine and basic research to treat HCC.

TI  - A multicenter phase II study of erlotinib and sorafenib in chemotherapy-naive 
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
PG  - 3078-87
LID - 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-09-3033 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: This multicenter, phase II study evaluates the efficacy and safety of 
      erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, plus sorafenib, 
      a multityrosine kinase inhibitor against vascular endothelial growth factor 
      receptors, in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung 
      cancer (NSCLC). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Chemotherapy-naïve patients with stage 
      IIIB/IV NSCLC received erlotinib (150 mg once a day) and sorafenib (400 mg twice 
      a day) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point 
      was the rate of nonprogression at 6 weeks. Secondary end points included 
      objective response rate (ORR), time to progression, overall survival, and adverse 
      events. Exploratory end points included pretreatment EGFR and KRAS mutation 
      status, pharmacokinetics, and cytochrome P450 polymorphisms. RESULTS: Fifty 
      patients initiated therapy. The nonprogression rate at 6 weeks was 74%: 12 (24%) 
      partial response and 25 (50%) stable disease. Ultimately, the ORR was 28%. Median 
      time to progression was 5.0 months [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 3.2-6.8 
      months]. Median overall survival was 10.9 months (95% CI, 3.8-18.1 months). Grade 
      3/4 adverse events included fatigue (16%), hand-foot skin reaction (16%), rash 
      (16%), diarrhea (14%), and hypophosphatemia (42%). There was one 
      treatment-related fatal pulmonary hemorrhage. Patients with wild-type EGFR had a 
      higher ORR (19%) than previously reported for single-agent erlotinib/sorafenib. 
      Erlotinib levels were lowered. This was associated with CYP3A4 polymorphism and 
      was possibly due to sorafenib. CONCLUSION: Despite a possible drug interaction, 
      sorafenib plus erlotinib has promising clinical activity in patients with stage 
      IIIB/IV NSCLC and has an acceptable safety profile. Further evaluation of this 
      combination as potential salvage therapy in EGFR mutation-negative patients and 
      the possible drug interaction is warranted.

TI  - Resistance of hepatocellular carcinoma to sorafenib can be overcome with 
      co-delivery of PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 and sorafenib in nanoparticles.
PG  - 573-587
LID - 10.1080/17425247.2020.1730809 [doi]
AB  - Background: The combination of BEZ235 with sorafenib (SFB) enhances 
      anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) efficacy of the two agents. However, 
      pharmacokinetic profiles in vivo and different endocytosis abilities of these two 
      drugs hinder their therapeutic application.Research design and methods: In this 
      work, we developed d-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate - 
      polycaprolactone polymer nanoparticles (NPs) for co-delivery of SFB and BEZ235 
      (SFB/BEZ235-NPs). Explored the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of 
      SFB/BEZ235-NPs through in vitro and in vivo experiments.Results: Stabilized 
      SFB/BEZ235-NPs were prepared with optimized drug ratio, yielding high 
      encapsulation efficiency, low polydispersity, and enhanced cellular 
      internalization in HepG2 cells. Synergistic cytotoxicity and pro-apoptotic 
      ability were documented. In vivo pharmacokinetic results revealed extended 
      circulation and bioavailability of SFB/BEZ235-NPs compared with those of free 
      drugs. SFB/BEZ235-NPs enhanced antitumor effectiveness in SFB-resistant HCC 
      xenograft mouse models.Conclusion: Taken together, the results of this study 
      describe a promising strategy using SFB and BEZ235 in a nanoparticle formulation 
      for treatment of SFB-resistant HCC.

AB  - PURPOSE: To define the safety, efficacy, and pharmacogenetic and pharmacodynamic 
      effects of sorafenib with gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in locally 
      advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Patients received gemcitabine 
      1000 mg/m(2) intravenously weekly × 3 every 4 weeks per cycle for 1 cycle before 
      CRT and continued for up to 4 cycles after CRT. Weekly gemcitabine 600 mg/m(2) 
      intravenously was given during concurrent intensity modulated radiation therapy 
      of 50 Gy to gross tumor volume in 25 fractions. Sorafenib was dosed orally 400 mg 
      twice daily until progression, except during CRT when it was escalated from 200 
      mg to 400 mg daily, and 400 mg twice daily. The maximum tolerated dose cohort was 
      expanded to 15 patients. Correlative studies included dynamic contrast-enhanced 
      MRI and angiogenesis genes polymorphisms (VEGF-A and VEGF-R2 single nucleotide 
      polymorphisms). RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled. No dose-limiting 
      toxicity occurred during induction gemcitabine/sorafenib followed by concurrent 
      CRT. The most common grade 3/4 toxicities were fatigue, hematologic, and 
      gastrointestinal. The maximum tolerated dose was sorafenib 400 mg twice daily. 
      The median progression-free survival and overall survival for 25 evaluable 
      patients were 10.6 and 12.6 months, respectively. The median overall survival for 
      patients with VEGF-A -2578 AA, -1498 CC, and -1154 AA versus alternate genotypes 
      was 21.6 versus 14.7 months. Dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI demonstrated higher 
      baseline K(trans) in responding patients. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent sorafenib with 
      CRT had modest clinical activity with increased gastrointestinal toxicity in 
      localized unresectable pancreatic cancer. Select VEGF-A/VEGF-R2 genotypes were 
      associated with favorable survival.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors 
      worldwide. In this study, sorafenib-loaded lipid-based nanosuspensions 
      (sorafenib-LNS) were first developed as an intravenous injectable formulation to 
      increase the efficacy of sorafenib against HCC. LNS were used as nanocarriers for 
      sorafenib owing to their desired features in increasing the solubility and 
      dissolution velocity, improving the bioavailability of sorafenib. Sorafenib-LNS 
      were prepared by nanoprecipitation and consisted of spherical particles with a 
      uniform size distribution (164.5 nm, polydispersity index =0.202) and negative 
      zeta potential (-11.0 mV). The drug loading (DL) was 10.55%±0.16%. Sorafenib-LNS 
      showed higher in vitro cytotoxicity than sorafenib against HepG2 cells (P<0.05) 
      and Bel-7402 cells (P<0.05). The in vivo biodistribution, biocompatibility, and 
      antitumor efficacy of sorafenib-LNS were evaluated in H22-bearing liver cancer 
      xenograft murine model. The results showed that sorafenib-LNS (9 mg/kg) exhibited 
      significantly higher antitumor efficacy by reducing the tumor volume compared 
      with the sorafenib oral group (18 mg/kg, P<0.05) and sorafenib injection group (9 
      mg/kg, P<0.05). Furthermore, the results of the in vivo biodistribution 
      experiments demonstrated that sorafenib-LNS injected into H22 tumor-bearing mice 
      exhibited increased accumulation in the tumor tissue, which was confirmed by in 
      vivo imaging. In the current experimental conditions, sorafenib-LNS did not show 
      significant toxicity both in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that 
      sorafenib-LNS are a promising nanomedicine for treating HCC.
