# Sorafenib model

## Data curation
- [ ] Hornecker2012 fix data Fig3



## simulation experiments
- [ ] MK: check fit_mappings
- [ ] MK: setup parameter fitting

## Model
- [ ] saturation of absorption at high doses; see bioavailability data from Hornecker2012
- [ ] include protein binding (very high at ~99.5%)

# Issues data
**Aboualfa2006**
- cirrhotic patients !
- sor concentration okay in steady state
- decreasing concentration after multiple dose / no peak
- very fast decrease ~ 2hrs

**Andriamanana2013**
- single subject
- sor concentration okay
- faster decrease/elimination, clear peak, overall okay

**Awada2005**
- first peak very nice
- steady state sor concentrations too low; ~2.5 x
- no clear peaks in steady state, decreasing concentration (same for last timepoint)

**Bins2017**
- no clear peak, mainly going down
- steady state sor concentration too low; ~ 3x
- SG much too high; ~ 100x

**Duran2007**
- no clear peaks
- steady state sor concentrations too low; ~3 x

**Ferrario2016**
- M2 concentration is much too low;  ~20 x?  (check data)
- sor could be higher; ~ 2x
- large interindividual variability; some peaks, but not all

**Fucile2015**
- steady state sor concentration too low; ~ 3-4x
- no peak at 3hr, already going down
- some patients going up in sor concentration at 3hrs, some down

**Fukudo2014**
- steady state sor concentration too low; ~10x, but very high dose 800 mg
- clear peak

**Huang2017**
- peaks pretty good
- sor concentration could be higher 2-3x
- M2 fitting perfectly ??

**Huh2021**
- sor concentration too low 3-5x
- peaks are nice

**Hussaarts2020**
- probably dose of ~200 mg, sor concentrations could be higher, 2-3x
- SG is much too high; 40-50x

**Ishii2014**
- steady state sor concentration could be higher 2-3x
- M2 is fitting pretty good

**Mammatas2020**
- sor concentration could be higher 2-3x
- clear peaks

**Strumberg2005**
- steady state sor concentration could be higher 2-3x
- baseline concentrations sor too high

**Zimmermann2012**
